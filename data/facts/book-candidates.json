    "The Book of General Ignorance What’s the name of the Piccadilly Circus statue in London?",
    "&#160; &#160; a ) Eros b ) The Angel of Christian Charity c ) Cupid d ) Anteros &#160; The famous monument in Piccadilly Circus was erected in 1892 to commemorate the work of Lord Shaftesbury, the Victorian philanthropist.",
    "Designed by the sculptor, Sir Alfred Gilbert, it represents Anteros and stands for, ‘reflective and mature love, as opposed to Eros or Cupid, the frivolous tyrant’.",
    "Because of the bow and the nudity, and people’s generally shaky grasp of classical mythology, everyone assumed it was Eros (known to the Romans as Cupid), the Greek god of love.",
    "As a result, a counter-rumour was spread by those wanting to protect Shaftesbury’s reputation, claiming the memorial was, in fact, the Angel of Christian Charity (Greek, agape ), a rather obscure, but less racy, alternative.",
    "Whatever its name, the statue was technologically groundbreaking, as it was the first in the world to be cast in aluminium.",
    "The use of a nude figure on a public monument was controversial, but it was generally well received.",
    "The Magazine of Art described it as ‘… a striking contrast to the dull ugliness of the generality of our street sculpture’.",
    "Old London hands tell you that the memorial used to stand bang in the middle of Piccadilly Circus, aiming its bow down Shaftesbury Avenue (‘he buries his shaft in Shaftes-bury’).",
    "During the Second World War the statue was removed for safe-keeping.",
    "When it was returned, so the story goes, the whey-faced bureaucrats of the London County Council decided to move it to one side and point it down Lower Regent Street instead.",
    "It was certainly removed, but it has always pointed down Lower Regent Street, because Gilbert designed it to face the direction of Shaftesbury’s home in Wimbourne St Giles, Dorset.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What did Nero do while Rome burned?",
    "&#160; &#160; He certainly didn’t play the fiddle, which wasn’t invented until the fifteenth century.",
    "The other charge was that Nero sang a song about the burning of Troy while Rome burned in AD 64, implying that he had set fire to the city himself in order to do so.",
    "In fact, when the fire broke out, he was more than 56 km (35 miles) away at his seaside holiday home.",
    "When told the news, he raced back to Rome and took personal charge of the fire-fighting efforts.",
    "The suspicion that he wanted to burn down Rome may have arisen from his stated ambition to redevelop the city.",
    "He eventually managed to shift the blame on to the Christians.",
    "As to what Nero actually did: he was a transvestite who loved acting in women’s clothes, singing, playing music and having orgies, and he had his mother killed.",
    "He was very proud of his musical abilities; his dying words are reported to have been ‘What an artist the world is losing in me!’ According to some, he generally accompanied himself on the kithara (related to the lyre) but he also played the bagpipes.",
    "Dio Chrysostom, a Greek writing around AD 100, noted: ‘They say that he can write, carve statues, play the aulos both with his mouth, and also with the armpit, a bag being thrown under it.’ Early in the sixth century, Procopius, a Greek historian, mentions that the bagpipes were the instrument of choice of the Roman infantry while the trumpet was used in the cavalry.",
    "Nero also invented ice cream (runners brought mountain snow flavoured with fruit juice) and his personal poisoner Locusta was history’s first documented serial killer.",
    "Locusta means ‘lobster’ or ‘locust’: Latin uses the same word for both.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What’s more likely: being killed by lightning or by an asteroid?",
    "&#160; &#160; Absurd as it may seem, death by asteroid is almost twice as likely.",
    "It is estimated that a large asteroid (nowadays known as a Near Earth Object or NEO) hits the Earth once every million years.",
    "A ‘dangerous’ NEO is one more than 2 km (1.2 miles) in diameter.",
    "The shock of the impact would be equivalent to one million megatons of TNT.",
    "If it happened, the death toll would be in excess of a billion, so the chances of you personally dying in any given year are one in six million.",
    "The chance of being killed by lightning in the UK in any given year is about one in ten million, roughly the same as being bitten by an adder.",
    "Lightning is a giant electrical spark, with a brightness equivalent to 100 million light bulbs going on and off.",
    "Some strokes reach a peak current of 100,000 amps and 200 million volts creating a temperature of 30,000 °C, five times hotter than the surface of the Sun.",
    "A bolt of lightning travels at speeds of up to 100 million feet per second, or over 115 million kph.",
    "Each ‘flash’ is really composed of several strokes, each lasting less than a millionth of a second.",
    "Because they are so short, the energy value of lightning is limited – a single stroke would only generate enough energy to run an average household for a day.",
    "Lightning strikes the Earth more 8 million times every day, or about fifty times every second.",
    "Strikes are commonest in coastal areas, occurring at a rate of about two per square kilometre per year.",
    "They don’t seem to do much damage: the electricity dissipates rapidly across the surface of the sea and whales have been observed to sing quite happily through ferocious electrical storms.",
    "Human beings, on the other hand, are struck by lightning ten times more frequently than they ought to be under the laws of chance.",
    "Men are struck by lightning six times more often than women.",
    "Between three and six Britons and a hundred Americans are killed by lightning every year, many of them because they are carrying portable lightning conductors about their person – golf-clubs, carbon-fibre fishing rods and underwired bras.",
    "If caught in a thunderstorm in the open, the safest position is well away from any trees, crouching down with your bottom sticking up in the air.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance How many people died in the Great Fire of London?",
    "Despite destroying 13,200 houses, 87 churches, 44 Livery Halls and over 80 per cent of the city, fewer than half a dozen deaths were recorded.",
    "The dead were: the maid of the baker who started it; Paul Lowell, a Shoe Lane watchmaker; an old man who rescued a blanket from St Paul’s but succumbed to the smoke; and two others who fell into their cellars in an ill-fated attempt to rescue goods and chattels.",
    "John Evelyn talks of the ‘stench that came from some poor creatures’ bodies’, and modern forensic evidence suggests that, given the intense heat, some corpses would almost certainly have been vaporised and thus not recorded.",
    "However, the leisurely pace of the fire (it burned for five days) made it relatively easy for people to evacuate, and the five cited remain the only definite casualties.",
    "The authorities’ response to the fire wasn’t overly speedy.",
    "The Lord Mayor, Thomas Bludworth, went back to bed on the first night claiming ‘a woman might piss it out’ and Samuel Pepys found time to safeguard his valuables by burying a ‘large parmazan cheese’ in his back garden.",
    "In the previous ‘Great Fire’ of London (in 1212), 3,000 people died, and in the two years prior to 1666, the plague had killed 65,000.",
    "The fire stopped the plague by destroying the black rats and their breeding grounds but the cost of the damage was estimated at £ 10 million.",
    "With the entire annual income of the City of London running at £ 12,000, these costs would, theoretically, have taken 800 years to pay off.",
    "Many of them camped out in a shanty town at Moorfields, or built shacks near their burned-out properties.",
    "But such was the speed of the rebuilding that by 1672 almost all had been rehoused.",
    "The fire started in the King’s bakery run by Thomas Farynor in Pudding Lane.",
    "Farynor denied this at the time and a deluded French watchmaker called Robert Hubert claimed he did it.",
    "Although it was evident to judge and jury that he couldn’t have done, they hanged him anyway.",
    "His corpse was torn apart by an angry mob, suspecting a Popish plot.",
    "Justice wasn’t finally done until 1986, when the Worshipful Company of Bakers claimed official responsibility and apologised for the fire.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance How did Roman Emperors order the death of a gladiator?",
    "Neither Roman spectators calling for the death of a gladiator, nor Roman Emperors authorising one, ever gave a thumbs down.",
    "In fact, the Romans didn’t use a ‘thumbs down’ sign at all.",
    "If death was desired, the thumb was stuck up – like a drawn sword.",
    "For a loser’s life to be spared, the thumb was tucked away inside the closed fist – as with a sheathed weapon.",
    "This is expressed in Latin as pollice compresso favor iudicabatur , ‘goodwill is decided by the thumb being kept in’.",
    "Before Ridley Scott agreed to direct Gladiator , Hollywood executives showed him the painting Pollice Verso by the nineteenth-century artist Jean-Léon Gérôme.",
    "In the painting, a Roman gladiator waits while the emperor stretches his thumb down to give the death sentence.",
    "Scott was captivated by the image, and decided on the spot that he must direct the film.",
    "Little did Scott know that the source of his inspiration was utterly wrong.",
    "The painting is single-handedly responsible for one of the greatest fallacies of the last two centuries, namely that ‘thumbs down’ indicated death.",
    "Historians agree that Gérôme wrongly assumed that the Latin pollice verso – ‘turned thumb’ – meant ‘turned down’ when in fact it meant ‘turned up’.",
    "If further proof were needed, in 1997 a Roman medallion of the second or third century AD was discovered in southern France.",
    "It shows two gladiators at the end of a battle and a referee pressing his thumb against a closed fist.",
    "The inscription reads: ‘Those standing should be released.’ The use of thumb signs can still be dangerously ambiguous in the modern world.",
    "In the Middle East, South America and Russia, a ‘thumbs up’ is considered to be a very rude insult, comparable to the Western V-sign.",
    "This has been problematic in Iraq, where American soldiers are unsure whether locals are welcoming them or about to blow them up.",
    "Desmond Morris, author of The Naked Ape , traces the positive connotations of the ‘thumbs up’ in Britain to the Middle Ages, where it was used to close business deals.",
    "It found a new lease of life in World War Two when US airforce pilots adopted it as a signal to ground crews before take-off.",
    "Ridley Scott was eventually told about the ‘thumbs down’&#160; fallacy but felt obliged to have Commodus give the ‘thumbs up’ when sparing Maximus, in order ‘not to confuse the audience’.",
    "ALAN Now, were the Romans the only … really the only people who had that kind of … men killing each other thing for sport?",
    "STEPHEN The Greeks didn’t do it, no, they … they had naked wrestling instead, which is much more the thing.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What was interesting about the birth of Julius Caesar?",
    "&#160; Almost nothing is known about the birth of Julius Caesar, except that, contrary to the assertion in the Oxford English Dictionary and countless other reference books, it did not take place by Caesarean section.",
    "Such operations did occur at the time, but they always involved the death of the mother, and Caesar’s mother Aurelia is known to have survived into his adulthood.",
    "The suggestion that he was born by C-section does not appear in any of the contemporary sources, and is first mentioned in medieval times.",
    "It was not used in a medical context in English before 1615.",
    "The confusion probably started with Pliny the Elder who, in his Natural History (about 77 AD ) claims that the first Caesar was ‘cut from his mother’s womb’.",
    "This may well have been true, but it wasn’t the Caesar we know as Gaius Julius Caesar.",
    "The Roman three-part naming convention meant that Gaius was his ‘given name’ and he was part of the ‘Caesar’ branch of the ‘Julian’ clan, so no one knows how many Caesars there had been previously.",
    "Nor do we know exactly what ‘Caesar’ means – and none of the meanings are particularly apt to our man.",
    "Or caeseries meaning ‘hairy’ (but he was balding); or caesius ‘grey’ (but his eyes were black) or even ‘elephant’ (from the Phoenician and perhaps applied to a Julian ancestor who had killed one).",
    "The Romans pronounced ‘Caesar’ kaisar (hence the German word Kaiser and the Russian czar , both ultimately derived from the Latin name).",
    "Roman emperors usually included ‘Caesar’ in their long formal names.",
    "It was invented by Cesar Cardini in an Italian restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico, in 1923.",
    "ALAN Stephen Wright said he was born by Caesarean section.",
    "It doesn’t really affect him except when he goes into a room, he leaves by the window .",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What’s a vomitorium for?",
    "&#160; Vomitorium, despite being derived from the Latin vomere , meaning ‘to spew forth’ isn’t the place where the Romans threw up after their meals.",
    "It was the name for the entrance or exit from an amphitheatre and is still used in that sense today in some sports stadiums.",
    "The vomitoria of the Colosseum in Rome were so well designed that it’s said the venue, which seated at least 50,000, could fill in fifteen minutes.",
    "(There were eighty entrances at ground level, seventy-six for ordinary spectators and four for the imperial family.) The confusion of the exit with a specialised vomit chamber appears to be a recent error.",
    "The earliest citation in the Oxford English Dictionary finds Aldous Huxley using the term in his 1923 comic novel, Antic Hay, but notes that the usage is ‘erron[eous]’.",
    "Lewis Mumford in The City in History (1961) compounded the confusion by saying the exits were named after the chambers where gluttons threw up ‘in order to return to their couches empty enough to enjoy the pleasures of still more food’.",
    "The problem with this theory is that no Roman writer ever refers to them, nor have any purpose-built rooms that fit the bill been found.",
    "Indeed, in ancient times vomiting seems to have been a standard part of the fine-dining experience.",
    "The orator Cicero says in Pro Rege Deiotaro (45 BC ) that Julius Caesar ‘expressed a desire to vomit after dinner’ and elsewhere suggests that the dictator took emetics for this purpose.",
    "But where did they do it, if there was no special room?",
    "Some sources suggest the street or garden; others are adamant it was at the table.",
    "PHILL Is it London’s least successful tourist destination?",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Where is the driest place on earth?",
    "Parts of the continent have seen no rain for two million years.",
    "A desert is technically defined as a place that receives less than 254 mm (10 inches) of rain a year.",
    "The Sahara gets just 25 mm (1 inch) of rain a year.",
    "Antarctica’s average annual rainfall is about the same, but 2 per cent of it, known as the Dry Valleys, is free of ice and snow and it never rains there at all.",
    "The next-driest place in the world is the Atacama Desert in Chile.",
    "In some areas, no rain has fallen there for 400 years and its average annual rainfall is a tiny 0.1 mm (0.004 inches).",
    "Taken as a whole, this makes it the world’s driest desert, 250 times as dry as the Sahara.",
    "As well as the driest place on earth, Antarctica can also claim to be the wettest and the windiest.",
    "Seventy per cent of the world’s fresh water is found there in the form of ice, and its wind speeds are the fastest ever recorded.",
    "The unique conditions in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica are caused by so-called katabatic winds (from the Greek word for ‘going down’).",
    "These occur when cold, dense air is pulled downhill simply by the force of gravity.",
    "The winds can reach speeds of 320 kph (200 mph) evaporating all moisture – water, ice and snow – in the process.",
    "Though Antarctica is a desert, these completely dry parts of it are called, somewhat ironically, oases.",
    "They are so similar to conditions on Mars that NASA used them to test the Viking mission.",
    "STEPHEN The Dry Valleys, in Antarctica, are free from ice and snow, and haven’t seen rain for two million years.",
    "So it’s a long way clear of its closest contender, the Atacama, parts of which haven’t recorded rain for a mere 400 years.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What did the Romans like to wear?",
    "&#160; Sandals, probably, laurel wreaths from time to time, but definitely not togas.",
    "The basic toga was a huge semi-circle of undyed wool so unwieldy that it took two other people to help put it on and, once on, the only way to stop it falling off was to camp around with the left arm crooked.",
    "The toga was an ornate, overblown Roman version of a kilt: a form of dress that started out as a practical garment but ended up as a symbolic form of national costume and definitely not the kind of thing you’d wear at home.",
    "The early togas were based on an Etruscan garment called the tebenna , a rough oblong of wool that doubled as both a tunic and a cloak.",
    "By the second century BC , it had become a vast semi-circular garment involving 200 square feet (20 feet wide x 10 feet high) of thick wool: useless for doing anything other than standing around in and about as sexy as a hessian sack.",
    "Despite the plethora of ‘How to Wear a Toga’ websites, there is no agreement as to the ‘correct’ way to put one on.",
    "Wearing a toga showed that you were a Roman (Virgil refers to them as the ‘toga people’ in the Aeneid ), a citizen, and a man.",
    "The historian Suetonius tells the story that, when the first Emperor, Augustus Caesar, noticed a group of men loafing about the city centre in lightweight practical cloaks – the Roman equivalent of a shell suit – he lost his temper and passed an edict making the toga compulsory anywhere in and around the Forum.",
    "A positive hindrance in battle, soldiers never wore them, so they also became a symbol of peace.",
    "Foreigners or slaves weren’t allowed to wear them, and finding a woman in a toga meant she was either a prostitute or an adulteress (nice ladies wore a gown or robe called the stola ).",
    "Being a man’s uniform, of course, they came in a huge range of styles and shades.",
    "There was the toga pull a (dark toga) for funerals; the toga praetexta (toga bordered with purple) for magistrates; the very fancy toga picta (patterned toga) for generals; and the brilliant white toga candida (bright toga) worn by those put up for election to political office (which is where we get the word ‘candidate’ from).",
    "So rather like a pinstriped suit or a tuxedo, togas were for business, fancy occasions or for getting buried in.",
    "Most of the time, Romans wore the far more practical combination of tunic and cloak.",
    "Toga parties were first mentioned in Tom Wolfe’s 1968 story, The Pump House Gang , and popularised by the 1978 film, Animal House , starring the late John Belushi.",
    "The togae featured in the film bear about as much resemblance to the original Roman garment as a thong does to a set of Victorian ladies undergarments.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What happened to most people accused of witchcraft in England?",
    "&#160; &#160; They were acquitted – and even if they had been found guilty they would have been hanged, not burned.",
    "According to Malcolm Gaskill, in his detailed history of the seventeenth-century witch-hunting craze, Witchfinders (2005), the popular perception (encouraged by Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code ) that five million women were burned at the stake for witchcraft in Europe between 1450 and 1750 is a massive overestimate.",
    "He believes, like most historians of the period, that 40,000 is closer to the true figure, and that a quarter of those executed were men.",
    "There are only 200 known executions in England directly resulting from an allegation of witchcraft.",
    "The Scots, French, Germans and Italians did all burn witches but, even then, it was more usual to strangle them at the stake and then burn the body afterwards, rather than burn them alive.",
    "In Britain, from 1440 to 1650, only one ‘witch’ was burned per century.",
    "Margery Jordemaine, the ‘Witch of Eye’, was burned at Smithfield on 27 October 1441; Isabella Billington was burned at York in 1650 (although she was hanged first); and Isabel Cockie was burned in 1596.",
    "An accusation of witchcraft in England by no means necessarily led to a death sentence.",
    "The Church – often blamed for persecuting witches – took no part in prosecutions.",
    "Accusers had to prove a witch had harmed them and English juries were surprisingly reluctant to convict.",
    "Seventy-five per cent of all witch trials ended in acquittal.",
    "Contrary to the popular perception of baying mobs, it appears there was a good deal of resistance to the idea of witch-hunting, shared by both judges and ordinary people – the practice was regarded as superstitious, prejudicial to public order, and unnecessarily expensive.",
    "Isabel Cockie’s funeral pyre, for example, cost 105 s .",
    "4 d .: the equivalent of more than £ 1,000 in today’s money.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What is the Number of the Beast?",
    "For 2,000 years, 666 has been the symbol of the dreaded Anti-Christ, who will come to rule the world before the Last Judgement.",
    "For many, it’s an unlucky number: even the European Parliament leaves seat no.",
    "The number is from Revelation, the last and strangest book in the Bible: ‘Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six .’ But it’s a wrong number.",
    "In 2005, a new translation of the earliest known copy of the Book of Revelation clearly shows it to be 616 not 666.",
    "The 1,700-year-old papyrus was recovered from the rubbish dumps of the city of Oxyrhynchus in Egypt and deciphered by a palaeographical research team from the University of Birmingham led by Professor David Parker.",
    "If the new number is correct, it will not amuse those who have just spent a small fortune avoiding the old one.",
    "In 2003, US Highway 666 – known as ‘The Highway of the Beast’– was renamed Highway 491.",
    "The Moscow Transport Department will be even less amused.",
    "In 1999, they picked a new number for the jinxed 666 bus route.",
    "The controversy has been around since the second century AD.",
    "A version of the Bible citing the Number of the Beast as 616 was castigated by St Iranaeus of Lyon ( c .130–200) as ‘erroneous and spurious’.",
    "Karl Marx’s friend Friedrich Engels analysed the Bible in his book On Religion (1883).",
    "Revelation was the first book of the New Testament to be written and it is full of number puzzles.",
    "Each of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet has a corresponding number, so that any number can also be read as a word.",
    "Both Parker and Engels argue that the Book of Revelation&#160; is a political, anti-Roman tract, numerologically coded to disguise its message.",
    "The Number of the Beast (whatever that may be) refers to either Caligula or Nero, the hated oppressors of the early Christians, not to some imaginary bogey-man.",
    "The fear of the number 666 is known as Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia.",
    "The fear of the number 616 (you read it here first) is Hexakosioidekahexaphobia.",
    "The numbers on a roulette wheel added together come to 666.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Where does the word ‘assassin’ come from?",
    "The earliest authority for the medieval sect called the Assassins taking hashish in order to witness the pleasures awaiting them after death is the notoriously unreliable Marco Polo.",
    "Most Islamic scholars now favour the more convincing etymology of assassiyun , meaning people who are faithful to the assass , the ‘foundation’ of the faith.",
    "This makes sense when you look at their core activities.",
    "The Al-Hashashin, or Nizaris as they called themselves, were active for 200 years.",
    "They were Shi’ite muslims, dedicated to the overthrow of the Sunni Caliph (a kind of Islamic king).",
    "The Assassins considered the Baghdad regime decadent and little more than a puppet regime of the Turks.",
    "The sect was founded by Hassan-i Sabbah in 1090, a mystic philosopher, fond of poetry and science.",
    "They made their base at Alamut, an unassailable fortress in the mountains south of the Caspian Sea.",
    "It housed an important library and beautiful gardens but it was Hassan’s political strategy that made the sect famous.",
    "He decided they could wield huge influence by using a simple weapon: terror.",
    "Dressed as merchants and holy men they selected and murdered their victims in public, usually at Friday prayers, in the mosque.",
    "They weren’t explicitly ‘suicide’ missions, but the assassins were almost always killed in the course of their work.",
    "They were incredibly successful, systematically wiping out all the major leaders of the Muslim world and effectively destroying any chance of a unified Islamic defence against the Western crusaders.",
    "What finally defeated them was, ironically, exactly what defeated their opponents.",
    "In 1256 Hulagu Khan assembled the largest Mongol army ever known.",
    "They marched westward destroying the assassins’ power base in Alamut, before sacking Baghdad in 1258.",
    "Baghdad was then the world’s most beautiful and civilised city.",
    "A million citizens perished and so many books were thrown into the river Tigris it ran black with ink.",
    "The city remained a ruin for hundreds of years afterwards.",
    "He drove Islam into Egypt and then returned home only to perish, in true Mongol style, in a civil war.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Which crime did Burke and Hare commit?",
    "In the early nineteenth century, there was a big increase in the number of students of anatomy.",
    "The law in Britain specified that the only corpses that could be legally used for dissection were those of recently executed criminals.",
    "This was quite an advance on the anatomy lessons in Alexandria in the third century BC , where criminals were dissected while still alive.",
    "The number of executions was inadequate to supply the demand and a brisk trade grew up in illicit grave robbing.",
    "Its practitioners were known as ‘resurrection men’.",
    "Burke and Hare were more proactive; they just murdered people and sold the bodies to an anatomist named Knox on an ‘ask no questions’ basis.",
    "When suspicion fell on them, Burke and his wife Helen tried to get their story straight before they were separated to be interviewed by the police.",
    "They agreed to say that a missing woman had left their house at seven o’clock.",
    "In return for his own immunity, Hare gave evidence against the Burkes.",
    "Burke was executed in 1829 but Helen got off ‘not proven’ and promptly vanished.",
    "Mr and Mrs Hare also disappeared, and Knox escaped prosecution altogether.",
    "The father of systematic dissection was a sixteenth-century Belgian anatomist called Andreas Vesalius.",
    "He published his findings in the classic seven-volume text On the Fabric of the Human Body.",
    "In those days, dissection was forbidden by the Catholic Church, so Vesalius had to work in secret.",
    "At the University of Padua, he built an ingenious table in case of unexpected visitors.",
    "It could be quickly flipped upside down, dumping the human body underneath and revealing a splayed-open dog.",
    "Over the last twenty years, dissection has fallen out of favour in medical schools – the victim of overly packed curriculums, a shortage of teachers and a general sense that it’s an antiquated chore in a high-tech world.",
    "It’s now possible to qualify as a doctor without ever having dissected a body at all.",
    "To save time and mess, students study ‘prosections’ – bodies that have already been professionally dissected – or computer simulations that do away with cadavers entirely.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What are chastity belts for?",
    "&#160; &#160; &#160; The idea of a crusader clapping his wife in a chastity belt and galloping off to war with the key round his neck is a nineteenth-century fantasy designed to titillate readers.",
    "There is very little evidence for the use of chastity belts in the Middle Ages at all.",
    "The first known drawing of one occurs in the fifteenth century.",
    "Konrad Kyeser’s Bellifortis was a book on contemporary military equipment written long after the crusades had finished.",
    "It includes an illustration of the ‘hard iron breeches’ worn by Florentine women.",
    "In the diagram, the key is clearly visible – which suggests that it was the lady and not the knight who controlled access to the device, to protect herself against the unwanted attentions of Florentine bucks.",
    "In museum collections, most ‘medieval’ chastity belts have now been shown to be of dubious authenticity and removed from display.",
    "As with ‘medieval’ torture equipment, it appears that most of it was manufactured in Germany in the nineteenth century to satisfy the curiosity of ‘specialist’ collectors.",
    "The nineteenth century also witnessed an upturn in sales of new chastity belts – but these were not for women.",
    "Victorian medical theory was of the opinion that masturbation was harmful to health.",
    "Boys who could not be trusted to keep their hands to themselves were forced to wear these improving steel underpants.",
    "But the real boom in sales has come in the last fifty years, as ‘adult’ shops take advantage of the thriving bondage market.",
    "There are more chastity belts around today than there ever were in the Middle Ages.",
    "Paradoxically, they exist to stimulate sex, not to prevent it.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What was Tutankhamun’s curse?",
    "The story of the ‘pharaoh’s curse’ striking down all those who entered Tutankhamun’s tomb when it was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922, was the work of the Cairo correspondent of the Daily Express (later repeated by the Daily Mail and the New York Times ).",

    "In fact, both were echoing a superstition that was less than a hundred years old, established by a young English novelist called Jane Loudon Webb.",
    "Her hugely popular novel The Mummy (1828) single-handedly invented the idea of a cursed tomb with a mummy returning to life to avenge its desecrators.",
    "This theme found its way into all sorts of subsequent tales – even Louisa May Alcott, author of Little Women , wrote a ‘mummy’ story – but its big break came with the advent of ‘Tutankhamun-fever’.",
    "No curse has ever been found in an ancient Egyptian tomb.",
    "Of the alleged twenty-six deaths caused by Tutankhamun’s ‘curse’, thorough research published in the British Medical Journal in 2002 has shown that only six died within the first decade of its opening and Howard Carter, surely the number one target, lived for another seventeen years.",
    "As late as 1970, when the exhibition of artefacts from the tomb toured the West, a policeman guarding it in San Francisco complained of a mild stroke brought on by the ‘mummy’s curse’.",

    "The oldest definite record of someone using a V-sign only dates back as far as 1901, when there is documentary footage of a young man who clearly didn’t want to be filmed using the gesture to camera outside an ironworks in Rotherham.",
    "This proves that the gesture was being used by the late nineteenth century, but it’s a long way from the bowmen at the Battle of Agincourt.",
    "According to the legend, English archers waved their fingers in contempt at their French counterparts, who were supposed to be in the habit of cutting off the fingers of captured bowmen – a fingerless archer being useless, as he could not draw back the string.",
    "Although one historian claims to have unearthed an eyewitness account of Henry V’s pre-battle speech that refers to this French practice, there is no contemporary evidence of the V-sign being used in the early fifteenth century.",
    "Despite there being a number of chroniclers present at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, none of them mentions any archers using this defiant gesture.",
    "Secondly, even if archers were captured by the French they were much more likely to be killed rather than be subject to the fiddly and time-consuming process of having their fingers amputated.",
    "Prisoners were usually only taken to be ransomed and bowmen were considered inferior merchandise who wouldn’t fetch a decent price.",
    "Finally, there are no known references of any kind to the Agincourt story that date back further than the early 1970s.",
    "What is certain is that the one-fingered ‘middle-finger salute’ dates back much further than the V-sign; it is obviously a phallic symbol – the Romans referred to the middle finger as the digitus impudicus , or lewd finger.",
    "In Arabic society, an upside-down version of ‘flicking the bird’ is used to signify impotence.",
    "Whatever its date of origin, the V-sign wasn’t universally understood until quite recently.",

    "A few weeks after the announcement to the American Astronomical Society, however, they had to admit they’d made a mistake in their calculations, and that the universe was, in fact, more a sort of dreary shade of taupe.",
    "Since the seventeenth century, some of the greatest and most curious minds have wondered why it is that the night sky is black.",
    "If the universe is infinite and contains an infinite number of uniformly distributed stars, there should be a star everywhere we look, and the night sky should be as bright as day.",
    "This is known as Olbers’ Paradox, after the German astronomer Heinrich Olbers who described the problem (not for the first time) in 1826.",
    "Nobody has yet come up with a really good answer to the problem.",
    "Maybe there is a finite number of stars, maybe the light from the furthest ones hasn’t reached us yet.",
    "Olbers’ solution was that, at some time in the past, not all the stars had been shining and that something had switched them on.",

    "Since no one has ever been to Mars, we have no idea what its ‘true’ colour is.",
    "In 2004, the New York Times stated that the early colour pictures from Mars were published slightly ‘over-pinked’, but that later adjustments showed the surface to be more like the colour of butterscotch.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance What colour is water?",
    "&#160; &#160; The usual answer it that it isn’t any colour; it’s ‘clear’ or ‘transparent’ and the sea only appears blue because of the reflection of the sky.",
    "You can see this in nature when you look into a deep hole in the snow, or through the thick ice of a frozen waterfall.",
    "If you took a very large, very deep white pool, filled it with water and looked straight down through it, the water would be blue.",
    "This faint blue tinge doesn’t explain why water sometimes takes on a strikingly blue appearance when we look at it rather than through it.",
    "Reflected colour from the sky obviously plays an important part.",
    "The sea doesn’t look particularly blue on an overcast day.",
    "But not all the light we see is reflected from the surface of the water; some of it is coming from under the surface.",

    "The ancient Greek poet Homer mentions only four actual colours in the whole of the Iliad and the Odyssey , roughly translated as black, white, greenish yellow (applied to honey, sap and blood) and purply red.",
    "When Homer calls the sky ‘bronze’, he means that it is dazzlingly bright, like the sheen of a shield, rather than ‘bronze-coloured’.",
    "In a similar spirit, he regarded wine, the sea and sheep as all being the same colour – purply red.",
    "Aristotle identified seven shades of colour, all of which he thought derived from black and white, but these were really grades of brightness, not colour.",
    "It’s interesting that an ancient Greek from almost 2,500 years ago and NASA’s Mars rovers of 2006 both approach colour in the same way.",
    "In the wake of Darwin, the theory was advanced that the early Greeks’ retinas had not evolved the ability to perceive colours, but it is now thought they grouped objects in terms of qualities other than colour, so that a word which seems to indicate ‘yellow’ or ‘light green’ really meant fluid, fresh and living, and so was appropriately used to describe blood, the human sap.",
    "There are more languages in Papua New Guinea than anywhere else in the world but, apart from distinguishing between light and dark, many of them have no other words for colour at all.",

    "If a perfectly symmetrical pan, with a tiny plughole and a plug which could be removed without disturbing the water, were filled and left for a week or so, so that all the motion settled completely, then it might in principle be possible to detect a small Coriolis effect, which would be anti-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the south.",

    "Camels’ humps don’t store water, but fat, which is used as an energy reserve.",

    "These laws are regularly flouted and there is a brisk child-slave trade, with children as young as four being kidnapped in Pakistan and kept in Arab camel camps.",
    "The only qualifications needed to become a jockey are not to weigh much and be able to scream in terror (this encourages the camels).",
    "The famous line from the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, ‘it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God’, is possibly a mistranslation, where the original Aramaic word gamta , ‘sturdy rope’, was confused with gamla , ‘camel’.",

    "What causes the abundance of hail is not fully understood.",
    "Kericho is the home of Kenya’s tea plantations, and a 1978 study showed that organic litter from the tea plants gets stirred into the atmosphere, where it acts as a nucleus around which hailstones can grow.",
    "Another theory is that the high altitude of the region could be to blame, as the shape of the terrain causes a large uplift of warm air which quickly condenses.",
    "This, and the reduced distance between the freezing level (about 3 miles up) and the ground, reduces the chance of hailstones melting.",
    "The average hailstone is about quarter of an inch across, but they can grow large enough to dent cars, shatter greenhouses and even injure people.",

    "This suggests he didn’t know for sure, and was trying to account for a name he had seen on other maps, possibly Cabot’s.",
    "The only place where the name ‘America’ was known and used was Bristol – not somewhere the French-based Waldseemüller was likely to visit.",
    "Significantly, he replaced ‘America’ with ‘Terra Incognita’ in his world map of 1513.",
    "Nor did he ever use the term ‘America’ for his discovery.",
    "New countries or continents were never named after a person’s first name, but always after the second (as in Tasmania, Van Diemen’s Land or the Cook Islands).",

    "Sign languages are not feeble, mimed versions of spoken or written speech but languages in their own right, with grammatical structures and syntax that do not correspond to their spoken or written forms.",
    "They differ from country to country even more than normal speech and it is not uncommon for sign languages to differ from city to city in the same country.",
    "From 1692 to 1910, nearly everyone on Martha’s Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, was bilingual in Martha’s Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL).",
    "The first deaf person arrived there in 1692 and, as a result of the remote nature of the island, and of intermarriage between people with the deafness gene, there was a very high rate of hereditary deafness in the area.",
    "In some villages, as many as one in four were deaf.",
    "Deafness on the island was so common that many people believed it to be contagious, but it was never considered a handicap.",
    "In 1817, the school now known as the American School for the Deaf opened on the mainland in Hartford, Connecticut, and most of the deaf children were sent there to be educated.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance How do the Cherokee pronounce ‘Cherokee’?",
    "The correct spelling (and pronunciation) is Tsalagi.",
    "‘Cherokee’ is a Creek Indian word meaning ‘people with another language’.",

    "There are about 350,000 Cherokee alive today, of whom about 22,000 speak the language.",
    "Their written alphabet was devised by Sequoyah (1776–1843), a Cherokee Indian also known as George Guess.",
    "He is the only known example in history of an illiterate person inventing a written language.",
    "Sequoyah was the son of a Cherokee mother and Nathaniel Guess, a German-born fur trader.",
    "He was either born handicapped or injured while young, hence his name Sik-wo-yi, which means ‘pig’s foot’ in Cherokee.",
    "He first became interested in creating a Cherokee alphabet in 1809.",
    "An accomplished silversmith and – despite his handicap – a brave soldier, Sequoyah fought for the US in the Cherokee Regiment under Andrew Jackson against the British and the Creek Indians at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814.",
    "A wealthy Georgian farmer called Charles Hicks showed him how to write his own name so he could sign his work as a silversmith.",
    "During his military service, Sequoyah became convinced of the need for an alphabet because he saw that – unlike the white soldiers – the Tsalagi were unable to write to or receive letters from home, and all battle orders had to be committed to memory.",
    "It took him twelve years to work out the alphabet.",
    "He called the eighty-five letters his ‘talking leaves’.",
    "On showing it to the Tsalagi Chiefs in 1821, it was accepted immediately, and was so simple that, within a year, almost the whole tribe became literate.",
    "Seven years after its adoption, the first Tsalagi language newspaper, The Cherokee Phoenix , was printed in 1828.",

    "Wages $25 a week.’ The Pony Express only lasted nineteen months and was superseded by the railroad.",

    "Their bark is up to 1.2 m (4 feet) thick, but the seeds are tiny, weighing 1/3,000th of an ounce each, about a billionth of the weight of the fully grown tree.",
    "The massive number of minuscule seeds of the Giant Sequoia is contained in egg-shaped cones less than 7.6 cm (3 inches) long.",
    "The tree’s thick bark also protects it against insects and lightning strikes.",
    "As a result, many trees are completely hollow but still standing.",
    "Paradoxically, forest fires are essential for the sequoia’s survival.",
    "Because of their thick bark they survive fires that completely destroy all other trees.",
    "The fires leave the forest clear of undergrowth, which enables the sequoia’s absurdly tiny seeds to survive.",
    "The trees also rely on the heat of the fires to open their tough seed cones and to expose the bare soil.",
    "Since time immemorial, forest fires had swept through the sequoia groves every five to fifteen years.",
    "In the 1950s and 1960s, the US Forest Service became concerned that the trees had stopped reproducing.",
    "Studies by Dr Richard Harteswood in the 1960s proved that it was because the US Forest Service had managed (quite brilliantly) to suppress all fires in the area since being formed in 1905.",

    "Baseball is not based on rounders, the first description of which didn’t appear in print until 1828, in the second edition of The Boy’s Own Book .",
    "The first US mention of rounders is in 1834 in The Book of Sports by Robin Carver.",
    "He credited The Boy’s Own Book as his source, but called the game ‘base ball’ or ‘goal ball’.",
    "In the first chapter of Northanger Abbey , written in 1796, the young heroine Catherine Morland is described as preferring ‘cricket, baseball, riding on horseback and running about the country to books’.",
    "The baseball authorities were so paranoid about the non-American origin of the game that in 1907 they carried out a shameless fraud.",
    "In a report into the game’s origins commissioned by the major league’s executive board, they advanced the story that the game was invented by the Civil War general and hero Abner Doubleday in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839.",
    "Despite the evidence of numerous bat-and-ball games being played all over early Puritan America, and the fact that Doubleday never visited Cooperstown, or ever mentioned baseball in his diaries, it stuck firm in the American psyche.",
    "As one wag put it, ‘Abner Doubleday didn’t invent baseball, baseball invented Abner Doubleday.’ If any one person should be credited with inventing the modern US game, it is Alexander Cartwright, a Manhattan bookseller.",
    "He had been a volunteer fireman and in 1842 founded the Knickerbocker Baseball Club (after the Knickerbocker Fire Engine Company).",
    "He and other firemen played on a field at 47th and 27th Streets.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance How did the game of rugby begin?",
    "&#160; According to the irrepressible old folk tale, rugby football was invented at Rugby School in November 1823, when seventeen-year-old player William Webb Ellis – ‘with a fine disregard for the rules’ – first picked up a ball and ran with it.",
    "It’s been acknowledged as a myth since 1895, when an investigation by the Old Rugbeian Society admitted that the only source for the story was an 1876 article in the school magazine by an old boy who had barely known Ellis and had left the school three years before the ‘famous’ incident.",
    "Other contemporaries had no memory of Ellis as either a rebel or a particularly gifted footballer (he became a low-Church evangelical Anglican priest).",
    "What they did confirm was that the rules at the school were complicated and that, while running with the ball in hand was definitely forbidden at the time, it did happen.",
    "In the unlikely event that Ellis did run with the ball, he certainly wasn’t the first.",
    "Games similar to rugby, involving the kicking and catching of balls, have been played throughout history, all over the world.",
    "The ancient Greeks, Romans, Chinese and Mayans all had their own versions of the running-with-a-ball game.",
    "Closer to home was caid in Ireland, criapan in Wales and the various English versions of Shrovetide football, where vast crowds of players hacked at and tripped up one another at will.",
    "Henry IV, Henry VIII (despite being a keen player himself), Elizabeth I, James I and Charles II all had it banned.",
    "Nevertheless, by the early nineteenth century, some version of the game was being played at most major public schools.",
    "What made Rugby stand out was that a group of boys produced a printed set of rules in 1845, the first written rules for any game of football.",
    "This formed the basis for the code adopted by the Rugby Football Union, founded at the Pall Mall Restaurant in London in 1871.",
    "Eight years earlier, the Football Association had been established, using a largely hands-free version played at Cambridge University.",
    "This marked the formal split between the two sets of rules, which evolved into the modern sports of soccer and rugby union.",
    "(Rugby league split from rugby union in 1895.) From time immemorial, all balls for such games had been made from inflated pig’s bladders, so they were always more egg-shaped than spherical.",
    "But, in 1862, Richard Lindon, a local Rugby shoemaker, whose wife had died from lung cancer caused by blowing up hundreds of diseased pig’s bladders, was inspired to develop a leather version with a rubber inner tube and so produced the world’s first round football.",
    "A request from Rugby School for an oval alternative (whose shape made it easier to catch and throw) meant that Lindon also gets the credit for the first proper rugby ball.",
    "Unfortunately, Lindon didn’t patent his invention, although through it he had rather more influence on rugby’s development than William Webb Ellis, who died in obscurity in France in 1872, completely unaware that, four years later, he would be immortalised as the ‘father of rugby’.",

    "Initially, players dribbled a soccer ball up and down any old indoor space.",
    "Points were earned by landing the ball in a peach basket nailed to a balcony or high on a wall.",
    "It was twenty-one years before anyone got round to putting a hole in the bottom of the basket.",
    "Until 1912, after every score, someone had to climb a ladder up to the basket or poke the ball out with a long pole.",
    "In 1959, twenty years after his death, James Naismith was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame (now called the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame).",

    "As far as mountains are concerned, the current convention is that ‘highest’ means measured from sea level to summit; ‘tallest’ means measured from the bottom of the mountain to the top.",

    "It’s easy enough to see where the top is, but where exactly is the ‘bottom’ of a mountain?",
    "For example, some argue that Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania – at 5,895 m (19,340 feet) – is taller than Everest because it rises straight out of the African plain, whereas Everest is merely one of many peaks topping the enormous base of the Himalayas, shared by the world’s next thirteen highest mountains.",
    "Others claim that the most logical measure ought to be the distance of a mountain’s peak from the centre of the Earth.",
    "Because the Earth is a flattened rather than a perfect sphere, the equator is about 21 km (13 miles) further from the centre of the Earth than the poles.",
    "This is good news for the reputation of those mountains that are very close to the equator – like Mount Chimborazo in the Andes – but it also means accepting that even the beaches in Ecuador are ‘higher’ than the Himalayas.",

    "Darwin paid him the compliment of using it himself in the 5th edition of The Origin of Species in 1869, commenting: ‘I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural selection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selection.",
    "But the expression often used by Mr Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.’ Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) was the eldest of nine children, all the rest of whom died in infancy.",

    "It did well in its first year, making Spencer £ 70, but demand dried up, Ackermann shot himself and the invention had entirely disappeared by 1899 when the Norwegian engineer Johann Vaaler filed his patent for the modern paperclip in Germany.",

    "You may think it’s a picky distinction but though the two look similar they are in fact quite different and are not even made of the same chemical elements.",
    "Many substances that appear to be radically different are actually made of exactly the same chemical elements.",
    "Combined in different proportions, they make stuff as wildly different as testosterone, vanilla, aspirin, cholesterol, glucose, vinegar and alcohol.",
    "Technically known as hydrated calcium sulphate, gypsum is one of the most widely available minerals in the world.",
    "It has been mined for at least 4,000 years – the plasterwork inside the Pyramids is made of gypsum – and it is used today in a huge range of industrial processes, the commonest of which is ordinary building plaster.",
    "About 75 per cent of all gypsum is used for plaster and products such as plasterboard, tiles and plaster of Paris.",
    "Gypsum is a key ingredient of cement and is used in the manufacture of fertiliser, paper and textiles.",
    "A typical new American home contains more than seven tons of gypsum.",
    "Plaster of Paris is so called because there are large deposits of gypsum in the clay soil in and around Paris, especially in Montmartre.",
    "Gypsum also occurs naturally in the form of alabaster, a snow-white, translucent material used to make statues, busts and vases.",
    "Alabaster can be artificially dyed any colour and, if heated, can be made to resemble marble.",
    "Powdered alabaster made into a salve was traditionally believed to be a cure for bad legs.",
    "It was common for people to chip pieces off church statues to make the ointment.",
    "Ironically, the word gypsum comes from the Greek gypsos , meaning ‘chalk’.&#160; STEPHEN Why is it called ‘plaster of Paris’?",
    "Poncier name … STEPHEN They tried plaster of Brentford and it didn’t really take off … &#160;",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Where does the equals sign come from?",
    "This essential constituent of mathematics wasn’t a product of the Greeks, the Babylonians or the Arabs, but the small coastal town of Tenby in south Wales.",
    "There, in 1510, the astronomer and mathematician Robert Recorde was born.",
    "Recorde was a child prodigy who rose to prominence as Royal physician to Edward VI and Queen Mary and later as controller of the Royal Mint.",
    "He was also a prolific author, writing a sequence of popular maths textbooks, of which The Whetstone of Witte (1557) is the most famous.",
    "Not only did it introduce algebra to an English audience for the first time it also introduced the equals sign, =.",
    "Recorde’s reason for adopting two parallel lines is refreshingly to the point: ‘bicause noe 2 thynges, can be moare equalle’.",
    "It took a while to catch on: | | and ae (from the Latin ‘ aequalis ’) were used well into the seventeenth century.",
    "One Recorde invention which didn’t stick was his word describing numbers to the eighth power, e.g., 28 = 256.",
    "Zenzizenzizenzic was based on the German zenzic , a version of the Italian censo meaning ‘squared’ (so it means ‘x squared, squared and squared again’).",
    "It does, however, comfortably hold the record for the number of ‘z’s in a single word.",
    "Despite his facility with numbers Recorde was less good with his personal finances.",
    "Poor political judgment meant he got on the wrong side of the Earl of Pembroke who called in a debt for the then astronomical sum of £1,000.",
    "This broke Recorde and he died in the King’s Bench debtors prison in Southwark, aged forty-eight.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What did Robert Bunsen invent?",
    "Robert Wilhelm Bunsen (1811–99) was an influential German chemist and teacher who devised or improved the design of a number of pieces of laboratory equipment still in use today.",
    "However, the item he is most famous for was actually invented by the English chemist Michael Faraday and then improved by Peter Desaga, Bunsen’s technician at the University of Heidelberg.",
    "Bunsen first became renowned in the scientific community for his work on arsenic.",
    "He eventually discovered the only known antidote to the poison, but not before losing his sight in one eye and almost dying of arsenic poisoning.",
    "He went on to produce a galvanic battery that used a carbon element instead of the much more expensive platinum.",
    "Using this he was able to isolate pure chromium, magnesium, aluminium and other metals.",
    "At the same time, he also solved the riddle of how geysers worked by building a working model in his lab.",
    "The need for a new style of burner grew out of his work with a young physicist called Gustav Kirchoff.",
    "Together they pioneered the technique that became known as spectroscopy.",
    "By filtering light through a prism they discovered that every element had its own signature spectrum.",
    "In order to produce this light by heating different materials, they needed a flame that was very hot but not very bright.",
    "Bunsen developed this new heat source using Faraday’s burner as his starting point.",
    "In the earlier model, the oxygen was added at the point of combustion, which led to a smoky, flickery flame.",
    "Bunsen conceived a burner where oxygen was mixed with gas before combustion in order to make a very hot, blue flame.",
    "He took his ideas to Desaga, who built the prototype in 1855.",
    "Within five years, Bunsen and Kirchoff had used the combination of their new burner and spectroscope to identify the elements caesium and rubidium.",
    "Their lab became famous, and Bunsen’s modesty and eccentricity (he never washed) brought him international renown.",
    "Mendeleev, the Russian inventor of the periodic table, was one of his many devoted pupils.",
    "Although he didn’t get to give his name to the burner he built, Desaga did get the rights to sell it, which his family did very successfully (and profitably) for several generations.",
    "Despite its iconic status, the Bunsen burner has now largely been replaced in chemistry labs by the cleaner and safer electric hot plate.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance &#160; &#160; &#160; Which bird lays the smallest egg for its size?",
    "Although it is the largest single cell in nature, an ostrich egg is less than 1½ per cent of the weight of the mother.",
    "A wren’s egg, by comparison, is 13 per cent of its weight.",
    "The largest egg in comparison with the size of the bird is that of the Little Spotted kiwi.",
    "Its egg accounts for 26 per cent of its own weight: the equivalent of a woman giving birth to a six-year-old child.",
    "An ostrich egg weighs as much as twenty-four hen’s eggs; to soft-boil one takes forty-five minutes.",
    "Queen Victoria tucked into one for breakfast and declared it among the best meals she had ever eaten.",
    "The largest egg laid by any animal – including the dinosaurs – belonged to the elephant bird of Madagascar, which became extinct in 1700.",
    "It was ten times the size of an ostrich egg, nine litres in volume and the equivalent of 180 chicken’s eggs.",
    "The elephant bird ( Aepyornis maximus ) is thought to be the basis for the legend of the fierce roc that Sinbad battles in the Arabian Nights.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What’s made of celluloid?",
    "&#160; &#160; Ping-pong balls and collar stiffeners.",
    "The main ingredient of celluloid is cellulose nitrate; modern film is made from cellulose acetate.",
    "Celluloid is generally regarded as the first plastic.",
    "In technical terms, it is a thermoplastic, which means it can be moulded each time it is re-heated.",
    "Cellulose occurs naturally in the cell walls of plants.",
    "Camphor comes from the camphor tree and smells distinctively of the mothballs into which it is also made.",
    "Celluloid was first manufactured in Birmingham, England by Alexander Parkes who patented it for use in waterproofing clothing in 1856.",
    "Another early use was as a cheap ivory substitute: for billiard balls and false teeth.",
    "Celluloid made the movies possible because of its flexibility.",
    "But it is both highly flammable and quick to decompose, so it is difficult to store and is now rarely used.",
    "It has largely been replaced by more stable plastics such as cellulose acetate (made from wood pulp) and polyethylene (a by-product of petroleum).",
    "Cellulose nitrate (or nitrocellulose) was invented by accident in 1846 by Christian Schönbein, the man who, six years earlier, had discovered ozone.",
    "Experimenting in his kitchen with nitric and sulphuric acid, he broke a bottle, wiped up the mess with his wife’s cotton apron, and put it on the stove to dry.",
    "It immediately burst into flames: Schönbein had discovered the first new explosive since gunpowder was invented by the ancient Chinese.",
    "It was smokeless and four times as powerful as gunpowder.",
    "Schönbein patented it at once and sold the exclusive manufacturing rights to John Hall and Sons.",
    "The next year, it blew up their factory in Faversham, Kent, killing twenty-one people.",
    "Lethal explosions followed in France, Russia and Germany.",
    "It was forty years before a stable use was found for cellulose nitrate when James Dewar and Frederick Abel created cordite in 1889.",
    "Seven years earlier, Dewar had invented the Thermos flask.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Who invented rubber boots?",
    "&#160; &#160; a ) Amazonian Indians b ) The Duke of Wellington c ) Charles Goodyear d ) Charles Macintosh &#160; Amazonian Indians have been making instant gumboots since time immemorial by standing knee-deep in liquid latex until it dries.",
    "The boots designed for, and named after, the Duke of Wellington in 1817 were made of leather.",
    "The first rubber boots didn’t appear until 1851, the year before the Duke died.",
    "Rubber was a disastrous failure for clothing when first tried because it either melted all over you in hot weather or set as&#160; hard as granite in winter.",
    "The breakthrough came in 1839 when Charles Goodyear heated rubber mixed with sulphur and accidentally spilt some on the family stove.",
    "Goodyear’s story is inspiring and tragic by turns.",
    "He struggled in desperate poverty all his life – six of his twelve children died of malnutrition – but rubber was his obsession and he never gave up trying to improve the qualities of what he called ‘vegetable leather’.",
    "The process he had inadvertently discovered solved the rubber problem by giving it a stable consistency.",
    "In his excitement Goodyear shared his samples with Thomas Hancock and Charles Macintosh, who became successful British rubber merchants.",
    "After analysing them, they were able to reproduce the process and patented it in 1843, calling it ‘vulcanisation’ after the Roman god of fire.",
    "Goodyear sued, unsuccessfully, and not for the first time was forced to spend time in a debtor’s prison – or his ‘hotel’ as he liked to call it.",
    "He died, still deep in debt, although widely acclaimed for his vision and perseverance.",
    "He once wrote: ‘Life should not be estimated exclusively by the standard of dollars and cents.",
    "I am not disposed to complain that I have planted and others have gathered the fruits.",
    "A man has cause for regret only when he sows and no one reaps.’ Forty years after he died, his immortality was assured when the founders of the Goodyear Rubber Company, now the world’s largest, named their business in his honour.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What Edison invention do English speakers use every day?",
    "The first written use of hello spelt with an ‘e’ is in a letter of Edison’s in August 1877 suggesting that the best way of starting a conversation by telephone was to say ‘hello’ because it ‘can be heard ten to twenty feet away’.",
    "Edison discovered this while testing Alexander Graham Bell’s prototype telephone.",
    "Bell himself preferred the rather nautical ‘Ahoy, hoy!’ Edison used to shout ‘hello!’ into telephone receivers at Menlo Park Labs while he was working on improvements to Bell’s design.",
    "His habit spread to the rest of his co-workers and then to telephone exchanges until it became common usage.",
    "Before ‘hello’ was used, telephone operators used to say, ‘Are you there?’ or ‘Who are you?’ or ‘Are you ready to talk?’ Once ‘hello’ became standard the operators were called ‘hello girls’.",
    "‘Hullo’ was used at the time purely to express surprise.",
    "Charles Dickens used the word in this way in Oliver Twist (1839) when the Artful Dodger first notices Oliver with a ‘Hullo, my covey!",
    "What’s the row?’ ‘Halloo’ was used to call hounds and ferrymen and was also a favourite word of Edison’s.",
    "When he first discovered how to record sound (18 July 1877) the word he shouted into the machine (the strip phonograph) was ‘Halloo’: ‘I tried the experiment, first on a strip of telegraph paper, and found that the point made an alphabet.",
    "Halloo!” into the mouthpiece, ran the paper back over the steel point and heard a faint “Halloo!",
    "I determined to make a machine that would work accurately, and gave my assistants instructions, telling them what I had discovered.’ The earliest recorded use of delegate badges saying ‘Hello, my name is…’ was at the first telephone operators’ convention in Niagara Falls in 1880.",
    "The word had existed before as ‘hullo’, H-U-double L-O, which never meant a greeting.",
    "Hullo, what’s this?’ We still use it in that sense.",
    "BILL Yes, when we … when we live our life like a 1950s detective film, yes!",
    "I say, mother, where’s the milk?’ STEPHEN You beast, you beast, you utter, utter beast!",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Was the first computer bug a real insect?",
    "In 1947, at Harvard University, the US Navy’s Mark II computer, housed in a large un-airconditioned room, was brought to a standstill by a moth getting itself jammed in a relay switch.",
    "The operators removed the battered corpse of the insect and taped it next to the entry in the log book before restarting the machine.",
    "The mechanical nature of this computer made it particularly vulnerable to insect interference.",
    "Most of the early computers, like ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) at the University of Pennsylvania were electronic and used moth-proof vacuum tubes.",
    "Used to mean an error or fault in a piece of machinery, the word ‘bug’ dates from the nineteenth century.",
    "The OED cites a newspaper report from 1889, in which Thomas Edison ‘had been up the two previous nights searching for a bug in his phonograph’.",
    "Webster’s dictionary also gives the modern meaning of ‘bug’ in its 1934 edition.",
    "And regardless of what numerous books and websites say, ‘de-bugging’ was also being used before the moth brought things to a standstill at Harvard.",
    "This is a rather satisfying example of life imitating language: a metaphor that, literally, came to life.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What is the most likely survivor of a nuclear war?",
    "Quite why so many of us persist in the belief that cockroaches are indestructible is an interesting subject in its own right.",
    "They have been around a lot longer than we have (about 280 million years) and are almost universally hated as hard-to-control carriers of disease.",
    "Plus, they can live for a week without their heads.",
    "But they aren’t invincible and, since the groundbreaking research of Drs Wharton and Wharton in 1959, we have known they would be one of the first insects to die in a nuclear war.",
    "The two scientists exposed a range of insects to varying degrees of radiation (measured in ‘rads’).",
    "Whereas a human will die at exposure to 1,000 rads, the Whartons concluded that the cockroach dies at a dose of 20,000 rads, a fruit fly dies at a dose of 64,000 rads, while a parasitic wasp dies at a dose of 180,000 rads.",
    "The king of radiation resistance is the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans which can tolerate a whopping 1.5 million rads, except when frozen, when its tolerance doubles.",
    "The bacterium – fondly known by its students as ‘Conan the Bacterium’ – is pink and smells of rotten cabbage.",
    "It was discovered happily growing in a can of irradiated meat.",
    "Since then it’s been found to occur naturally in elephant and llama dung, irradiated fish and duck meat and even in granite from Antarctica.",
    "Conan the Bacterium’s resistance to radiation and cold, and its ability to preserve its DNA intact under these extreme conditions, have led NASA scientists to believe it might hold the clue to finding life on Mars.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What’s the best use for Marmite?",
    "&#160; &#160; &#160; Solving the Arab–Israeli conflict in the Middle East No less a person than the inventor of lateral thinking himself, Edward de Bono, advised a Foreign Office committee in 2000 that the whole sorry business might be due, in part, to low levels of zinc found in people who eat unleavened bread, a known side-effect of which is aggression.",
    "He suggested shipping out jars of Marmite to compensate.",
    "The popular belief that eating Marmite will keep mosquitoes at bay has no basis in scientific fact.",
    "Sadly, the B group vitamins present in Marmite (and beer for that matter) don’t appear to have any effect on mosquito behaviour.",
    "Marmite, the love-it-or-hate-it spread, was invented in 1902 in Burton-on-Trent by the Marmite Food Extract Company and contains yeast extract, salt, wheatgerm extract, niacin, thiamine, spices, riboflavin and folic acid.",
    "The exact recipe is – you guessed it – ‘a closely guarded secret’.",
    "Since 2000 it’s been owned by Unilever, proprietors of Persil, Domestos, Colman’s, Cif, Cornetto and Impulse.",
    "Marmite exerts a strange hold on British popular consciousness – its taste is one of the things that ex-pats claim they miss most about home.",
    "Bill Bryson has described it as ‘an edible yeast extract with the visual properties of an industrial lubricant’.",
    "A marmite is a traditional French lidded cooking pot, the shape of which is echoed by that of the Marmite jar.",
    "The word originally meant ‘hypocrite’, deriving from marmouser or marmotter , ‘to murmur’ (perhaps because both hypocrites and cooking pots hide things from view and bubble away quietly).",
    "CLIVE But the whole point about Marmite … They advertise it on the basis that some people love it and some people hate it.",
    "So he’d have solved the problem, then they’d have wars between the … the pro-Marmiters and the anti-Marmiters!",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Which is the hottest part of a chilli?",
    "&#160; &#160; A generation of television chefs have had us believe that the hottest bit of the chilli pepper is its seeds.",
    "It is the central membrane to which the seeds are attached.",
    "The membrane contains the highest levels of capsaicin, the colourless, odourless compound that gives chillies their distinctive heat.",
    "Chilli heat is measured using the Scoville Scale, created by American pharmacist Wilbur L.",
    "In his early tests, Scoville mixed a range of chilli extracts dissolved in alcohol and diluted in sugar water.",
    "He asked a panel of testers to consume a range of concentrations of various chillies until they ceased to taste hot.",
    "A numerical scale was then devised according to the heat of the chillies.",
    "A jalapeño pepper, for example, is said to have 4,500 Scoville Heat Units (SHU), because it has to be diluted 4,500-fold before it loses its heat.",
    "The hottest chilli in the world is from Dorset, on the south-west coast of England.",
    "Michael and Joy Michaud’s Dorset Naga – naga is Sanskrit for ‘serpent’ – was grown on a plant from Bangladesh.",
    "It was tested by two American laboratories in 2005, and came in at a palate-torching 923,000 SHU.",
    "Even half a small Naga would render a curry inedible, and consuming a whole one would mean a trip to hospital.",
    "To put it in perspective, pure capsaicin powder delivers 15–16 million SHU.",
    "It is so hot that pharmacists who experiment with it must work in a filtered ‘tox room’ wearing a full protective body-suit with a closed hood to prevent inhalation.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Where do tulips come from?",
    "&#160; &#160; Whether from Amsterdam or elsewhere, tulips are as famous a symbol of Holland as windmills and clogs, but they are not native to the Netherlands.",
    "The natural habitat of the tulip is mountainous terrain.",
    "It was only in 1554 that the first tulips were imported from Constantinople (now Istanbul) into the Netherlands.",
    "Wild tulips can be found in southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia up to north-east China.",
    "The tulip is the national flower of both Turkey and Iran.",
    "The name of the flower comes from the word tülbent which is the Turkish pronunciation of the Persian word dulband , meaning turban.",
    "This is because of what etymologists call a ‘fancied resemblance’ of the shape of the flower when not in full blossom to a turban (or perhaps because the Turks traditionally wore the bloom in their headwear).",
    "Tulips did become exceedingly popular in the Netherlands (as it should be called: ‘Holland’ only describes two of the country’s twelve provinces) but the stories of the great ‘tulipomania’ bubble of the early seventeenth century now look rather overcooked.",
    "It’s true that the price of tulips was inflated (and that one bulb of the most valuable plants could cost as much as a house) but there are many instances of even higher values being achieved in other countries for other plants, for example, orchids in nineteenth-century England.",
    "At its wildest, Garber says that the Dutch speculation ‘was a phenomenon lasting one month in the dreary Dutch winter of 1637 … and was of no real economic consequence’.",
    "Today, Holland produces about three billion tulip bulbs a year, of which two billion are exported.",

    "There are frescoes in Minoan Crete dated to 1600 BC showing saffron being gathered.",
    "Alexander the Great washed his hair in saffron to keep it a lovely shiny orange colour.",
    "It was a seriously upmarket shampoo: at that time saffron was as rare as diamonds, and more expensive than gold.",
    "In fifteenth-century Nuremberg and during the reign of Henry VIII in England, adulterating saffron by mixing it with something else was a capital offence.",
    "Culprits were burned at the stake, or buried alive with their illegal wares.",
    "The town of Saffron Walden in Essex takes its name from the spice: it was the centre of the English saffron trade.",
    "Legend has it that this dates from the fourteenth century when a pilgrim from the Middle East arrived with a stolen bulb of a saffron crocus hidden in his stick.",
    "Only the arrival of tea, coffee, vanilla and chocolate saw its cultivation decline, although it remained an important crop in Italy, Spain and France.",
    "The word saffron comes from the Arabic asfar , meaning ‘yellow’.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What can you tell about a man from his shoe size?",
    "In most cases, it won’t even tell you the size of his feet.",
    "A study in 2002, published in the British Journal of Urology International , scientifically proved there is no link between shoe size and penis size.",
    "Nurses at St Mary’s Hospital and University College Hospital in London measured the foot size and penis length of 104 men.",
    "In each case, the penis was ‘gently stretched’ before it was measured, but no correlation was found.",
    "Previous studies, which had seemed to indicate a mild link between the two, relied on simply asking male subjects for their intimate personal details rather than, in this case, whipping them out for some hard evidence.",
    "The average Caucasian man’s penis is 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) long when limp and 5.1 inches long (12.9 cm) when erect.",
    "Most penises stop growing when their owner is in his sixteenth year, although there is some evidence to suggest that it begins to shrink in middle age.",
    "Most men who opt for penis enlargements are in fact average-sized rather than small, though no doubt the people who carry out the operations have good reason to encourage them to think otherwise.",
    "Even more surprisingly, most people don’t know how big their own feet are and they don’t wear the correct shoe size.",
    "Scholl College of Podiatric Medicine in Chicago, three-quarters of people wear the wrong-sized shoes.",
    "The reason for this may be that they stick to a size they were measured for when young and fail to realise that their feet change shape throughout their lives.",
    "Or it may be that they like to get value for money and wear and re-wear a pair of shoes even if they don’t fit.",
    "Somewhat stating the obvious, podiatrists (‘foot doctors’ to you and me) recommend trying on shoes first rather than buying a standard size off the peg, as each brand uses slightly different measurements, though they stop short at suggesting you buy a different size shoe for each foot.",
    "Alternatively, you could give up wearing shoes altogether.",
    "In 2007, a South African study in the podiatry journal, The Foot, looked at the feet of 180 people from three different ethnic backgrounds (Sotho, Zulu and European) and compared them to 2,000-year-old skeletons.",
    "The research concluded that human beings had healthier feet, joints and posture before the invention of shoes.",
    "The Zulu, who often go barefoot, had the healthiest feet of the three groups in the study.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What drives human sperm wild?",
    "It appears sperm have ‘noses’ which they use to navigate towards a woman’s egg.",
    "Researchers experimented with a range of floral fragrances and lily of the valley came top, getting the random sperm wiggling in the same direction at twice the normal speed.",
    "The research was carried out at Ruhr University in Germany in 2003.",
    "They discovered a new sperm protein, hOR17-4, which acted as a receptor for sperm in exactly the same way as protein sensors in the nose detect smells.",
    "They then tested their new sperm ‘nose’ on hundreds of synthetic compounds, many of them used to mimic floral scents in commercial perfumes.",
    "One of these, bourgeonal, is used to create the lily of the valley fragrance.",
    "It had two dramatic effects on the behaviour of sperm: doubling its speed and changing undirected swimming behaviour to direct movement.",
    "The ‘foot-to-the-floor’ effect seems to derive from hOR17-4 making the sperm wag their ‘tails’ harder.",
    "Bourgeonal is now being used in fertility treatment to pick out the Mark Spitzes of the sperm world.",
    "JACKIE It depends whether they’re male or female sperm.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance Why do racing cyclists shave their legs?",
    "&#160; Because it feels nice, apparently, and also helps if they get injured.",
    "The idea that it gives them a speed advantage is ludicrous.",
    "There is no aerodynamic advantage in cycling with shaved legs.",
    "It’s true that swimmers who shave their bodies can gain a 2 per cent boost to their speed, but that’s in water.",
    "The main reason given for leg-shaving among cyclists is that it makes it easier to clean a wound after a fall, and sticking plasters stay on better (and pull off less painfully).",
    "They also have their calves massaged a lot, and that’s more comfortable on a shaved leg.",
    "Personal aesthetic considerations may also be a consideration – it’s part of le look .",
    "Austrian cyclist René Haselbacher had his shorts ripped off in a fall in the 2003 Tour de France, and it emerged that he had comprehensively shaved where the wind doesn’t blow.",
    "The original idea of the Tour de France was to sell copies of L’Auto newspaper, a publicity stunt that was such a success it destroyed the paper’s rival Le Vélo in the process.",
    "The winner of the first Tour (in 1903) was well-known French rider Maurice Garin, nicknamed the ‘Chimney Sweep’.",
    "In the second year, almost everyone cheated: fans left nails in the road in front of their favourites’ rivals while the competitors themselves gained an edge by taking their bicycles on car trips and even train rides.",
    "The winner actually finished fifth, but the first four riders across the line were disqualified.",
    "It used to be that a rider had to make his own repairs.",
    "In 1913, Eugène Christophe snapped some forks on his bike and so begged a piece of metal and fixed it.",
    "However, he was punished with a time delay: a young boy had helped him by operating the bellows at his hastily borrowed forge.",
    "In 1919, the first person to be offered the famous yellow jersey (awarded for being in the lead) turned it down because he thought it would make him a more obvious target for his rivals.",
    "The Tour is the toughest sporting event in the world.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance What was the first invention to break the sound barrier?",
    "Whips were invented in China 7,000 years ago but it wasn’t until the invention of high-speed photography in 1927 that the ‘crack’ of the whip was seen to be a mini sonic-boom and not the leather hitting the handle.",
    "The whip’s crack is caused by a loop that forms in the whip as you flick it.",
    "The loop travels along the length of the whip and, because the leather tapers to a fine tip, the loop speeds up as it travels, reaching over ten times its original speed.",
    "The ‘crack’ is when the loop breaks the sound barrier at about 1,194 kph (742 mph).",
    "The Bell X1 was the first aircraft to break the sound barrier, piloted by Chuck Yeager in 1947.",

    "Improbably enough, the dodo was a species of pigeon, but, unlike the other famous extinct fowl, the passenger pigeon, it was not hunted for food as it was barely edible – the Dutch called it walgvogel , the disgusting bird.",
    "The Portugese name dodo is also unkind; it means ‘simpleton’ (as in ‘durrr-durrr’), a reference to the fact that it had no fear of humans so didn’t run away, making it of limited value as a sporting bird.",
    "In 1755, the director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford decided that their specimen was too moth-eaten to keep and threw it on a bonfire.",
    "A passing employee tried to rescue it, but could only save its head and part of one limb.",

    "If all it took were sand – which oysters spend their lives sucking in and blowing out – pearls would be far more common.",
    "Parasitic worms, starfish, snails, sponges and mussels attack them by prising open or drilling into their shells.",
    "The larger creatures usually kill the oyster, but the worms trigger its defence mechanism and may be contained in a ‘pearl sac’ then smothered by repeated coatings of nacre, to stop their irritating wriggles.",
    "Nacre is an extraordinary substance: a mixture of calcium carbonate (from which marble is made) and an organic secretion very like keratin (the material responsible for human fingernails).",
    "The nineteenth-century French natural scientist Raphael Dubois said: ‘The most beautiful pearl is nothing more, in fact, than the brilliant sarcophagus of a worm.’ Oysters with parasites in them are often spurned by polite oyster society and go and live under rocks out of the way, which makes it slightly easier for pearl-fishers to find them.",
    "Nevertheless, a finished pearl can tale up to fifteen years to make and a ton of oysters might yield as few as three pearls.",
    "The chances of any of them being perfectly spherical are, literally, one in a million.",

    "&#160; &#160; Catherine the Great, Empress of all the Russias, died of a stroke, in bed, in 1796, aged sixty-seven.",
    "It’s true that when she collapsed from the stroke she was at her toilette , but she was cared for thereafter in bed, where she died.",
    "She wasn’t crushed by a well-hung stallion being lifted on to her, or through injuries sustained by crushing her chamber pot under her enormous derrière .",
    "Nor is there any evidence that she had an especial fondness for horses as a younger woman, except as creatures to ride on.",
    "It may be a spectacularly successful piece of black propaganda invented by her resentful son, Paul I, whose court was notoriously gossipy.",
    "Or it may be the dastardly French, who were at war with a coalition of nations including Russia in the years after the Revolution (the stories about Marie Antoinette were even worse).",
    "Wherever it started it is certainly true that Catherine’s behaviour created an erotic frisson .",
    "She did take many lovers and it seems some of them were road-tested on her ladies-in-waiting.",
    "If they passed, they were given an honorary position and installed at Court.",
    "One of her procurors was a former lover himself – Potemkin of Battleship fame, who died at the age of fifty-two ‘in consequence of eating a whole goose while in a high state of fever’.",
    "Whether her extra-marital relationships number just eleven (confirmed by her correspondence) or the 289 cited by scandalmongers, Catherine’s more important legacy is in her political and cultural achievements.",
    "She built more of St Petersburg than Peter the Great himself; sorted out the complexity of Russian law; commissioned magnificent gardens; filled Russian galleries with great European art; introduced smallpox inoculation and became a patron of writers and philosophers across Europe, including Diderot and Voltaire, who called her ‘the Star of the North’.",
    "Her son Czar Paul I (1754–1801) once court-martialled and executed a rat for knocking over his toy soldiers.",
    "Later, he had his horse courtmartialled and sentenced to fifty lashes.",
    "In due course, he was murdered by his own nobles (without trial) and replaced by his son.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What surprised John Ruskin on his wedding night?",
    "&#160; &#160; It is generally believed that John Ruskin was shocked into impotence by the sight of his wife Effie’s pubic hair on their wedding night.",
    "The story was that, as the most influential art critic of his day, his knowledge of the naked female form derived entirely from the ‘pubes-free’ marble of classical sculpture and painting.",
    "There is no evidence for this theory, which was first advanced in Mary Lutyens’s biography of the Ruskins in 1965, and it is clear from a frank correspondence he had with his mother that he was not ignorant in the way suggested.",
    "The notion of extreme prudery amongst the Victorians is, at least to some degree, an invention of the mid-twentieth century.",
    "What is true is that Ruskin did not consummate the marriage.",
    "This situation continued for six years until, on a painting expedition, Ruskin left Effie alone in a rustic cabin with his friend, the painter John Everett Millais (1829–96).",
    "Millais knew what to do, and Effie enjoyed it so much she filed for divorce.",
    "The marriage was annulled on the grounds of Ruskin’s ‘incurable impotency’.",
    "Effie married Millais and had a large family with him.",
    "The whole business caused a scandal and meant that Effie was no longer asked to any party at which the Queen would be present.",
    "Ruskin’s underlying problem was that he had a penchant for young girls.",
    "In spite of this (or maybe because of it), Ruskin was a huge influence on Victorian art and architecture, an early promoter of Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites, a founding father of the Trades Unions and the man behind the Arts and Crafts movement and the National Trust.",
    "He paid the Friends of the Guild of St George to sweep the steps in front of the British Museum.",
    "He resigned as Slade Professor of Art when vivisection was allowed in the medical school, and in later life went mad, believing that his cook was really Queen Victoria.",
    "Gandhi cited him as the single greatest influence in his life.",
    "Another possible example of pubic hair being blamed for dysfunction concerns the alleged affair of D.",
    "Lawrence apparently left the naked Brett in bed having made the excuse for his incapacity: ‘your pubes are wrong’.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance How long do your fingernails and hair grow after death?",
    "&#160; &#160; ‘For three days after death, hair and fingernails continue to grow but phone calls taper off’ was one of the late, great Johnny Carson’s best lines.",
    "But hair and fingernails don’t grow at all after death.",
    "When we die, our bodies dehydrate and our skin tightens creating an illusion of hair and nail growth.",
    "The idea owes a great deal to Erich Maria Remarque’s classic novel All Quiet on the Western Front , in which the narrator, Paul Bäumer, reflects on the death of his friend Kemmerich: ‘It strikes me that these nails will continue to grow like lean fantastic cellar-plants long after Kemmerich breathes no more.",
    "They twist themselves into corkscrews and grow and grow, and with them the hair on the decaying skull, just like grass in a good soil, just like grass …’ Despite this, there is plenty of action after death: your body will positively thrive with life.",
    "Bacteria, beetles, mites and worms will enjoy a feeding frenzy, contributing enormously to the decomposition process.",
    "One of your body’s most enthusiastic customers is the humpbacked phorid or ‘coffin fly’.",
    "The fly, also known as the ‘scuttle fly’ because of its awkward flight, is able to live its entire life underground in a corpse.",
    "Scuttle flies are particularly greedy when it comes to human flesh, and it’s not uncommon for them to dig nearly a metre (3 feet) down through the soil to reach a buried coffin.",
    "One type of phorid, from the genus Apocephalus , has recently been deployed in an attempt to control the rampant fire ant populations in the American south-east which were introduced via a Brazilian cargo ship in the 1930s.",
    "The larvae feed on the contents of the fire ant’s head and emerge several days later.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance What did Atlas carry on his shoulders?",
    "Atlas was condemned to support the sky by Zeus after the Titans revolted against the Olympians.",
    "However, he is often shown holding up something that looks like the globe, most famously on the cover of a collection of maps by the Flemish geographer Mercator.",
    "Closer inspection reveals that this globe was, in fact, the heavens, not the Earth.",
    "Furthermore, Mercator had actually named his volume, not after the Titan, but the mythical philosopher King Atlas of Mauretania (after whom the mountains are named) who was supposed to have produced the first such ‘celestial’ (as opposed to ‘terrestrial’) globe.",
    "The volume became known as Mercator’s Atlas and the name was applied to any collection of maps thereafter.",
    "Gerard Mercator, the son of a cobbler, was born Gerard Kremer, in 1512.",
    "His surname meant ‘market’ in Flemish, so he latinised this to Mercator, meaning ‘marketeer’.",
    "Mercator was the father of modern cartography and arguably the most influential Belgian of all time.",
    "His famous projection of 1569 – the first attempt to portray the world accurately with straight lines of latitude and longitude – remains the most persuasive vision of ‘the world’ for most people.",
    "More importantly it enabled accurate navigation for the first time, giving the Age of Discovery its scientific basis.",
    "Because of its distortions, Mercator’s projection is now rarely used in maps and atlases: in 1989 the leading US cartographic associations asked for it to be eliminated altogether.",
    "Oddly, that hasn’t stopped NASA using it to map Mars.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance How high is Cloud Nine?",
    "&#160; &#160; According to the International Cloud Atlas scale, Cloud 0 is the highest type of cloud, known as cirrus, the wispy streaks that can be as high as 12,000 metres (nearly 40,000 feet).",
    "Cloud Nine is the cumulonimbus, the massive, brooding thunder cloud.",
    "It’s at the bottom of the scale because a single cloud can cover the whole range from as low as a few hundred feet to the very edge of the stratosphere (15,000 metres or nearly 50,00 feet).",
    "As with the origins of most phrases, it’s unlikely that ‘cloud nine’ can be tied to one specific source.",
    "Clouds seven, eight, seven and thirty-nine have all been recorded, so it seems likely that people settled on nine because it’s regarded as a lucky number (‘dressed up to the nines’ and ‘the whole nine yards’ have equally obscure origins).",
    "And the idea of being carried along on a big billowy cloud is undeniably attractive.",
    "The International Cloud Atlas was published in 1896, as a result of the International Meteorological Conference establishing a Cloud Committee to agree an international system for the naming and identification of clouds.",
    "The ten categories were themselves based on the pioneering work of Luke Howard (1772–1864), an English chemist, who published his Essay on the Modification of Clouds in 1802.",
    "Howard’s work was influenced by his experience of freak weather conditions as a child, when volcanic eruptions in Japan and Iceland in 1783 created a ‘Great Fogg’ which covered much of Europe.",
    "His work inspired the landscape paintings of John Constable, J.",
    "Goethe wrote four poems in Howard’s honour and considered this modest English Quaker to be the ‘Godfather of Clouds’.",
    "Clouds are collections of tiny water droplets or ice crystals held in suspension in the atmosphere.",
    "The droplets or crystals are formed by the condensation of water vapour around even smaller particles of things like smoke or salt.",
    "Cirrus clouds are the only clouds in the sky made entirely of ice.",
    "They are much more common in the atmosphere than was once thought and help to regulate the Earth’s temperature.",
    "They are often triggered by the condensation trails of high-flying jets.",
    "When air traffic was stopped after 11 September 2001, daily temperature variation across the USA grew by up to 3 °C over the following forty-eight hours as the cirrus protection shrank: letting more heat out by night and more sunlight in by day.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What makes champagne fizz?",
    "In a perfectly smooth, clean glass, carbon dioxide molecules would evaporate invisibly, so for a long time it was assumed that it was slight imperfections in the glass which enabled the bubbles to form.",
    "However, new photographic techniques have shown that these nicks and grooves are much too small for bubbles to latch on to: it’s the microscopic particles of dust and bits of fluff in the glass that enable them to form.",
    "Technically speaking, the dirt/dust/lint in the glass act as condensation nuclei for the dissolved carbon dioxide.",
    "According to Moët et Chandon, there are 250 million bubbles in the average bottle of champagne.",
    "Chekhov’s last words were ‘I haven’t had champagne for a long time.’ German medical etiquette of the time demanded that when there was no hope, the doctor would offer the patient a glass of champagne.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What shape is a raindrop?",
    "&#160; &#160; Raindrops are spherical, not teardrop-shaped.",
    "Ball-bearing and lead-shot makers exploit this property of falling liquids in their manufacturing process: molten lead is dropped through a sieve from a great height into a cooling liquid, and comes out spherical.",
    "Shot-drop towers used to be built for the purpose – until the Festival of Britain in 1951 there was one next to Waterloo Bridge in London.",
    "At just over 71 m (234 feet) Phoenix Shot Tower in Baltimore (still standing) was the tallest building in America until the Washington Monument surpassed it after the Civil War.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What produces most of the earth’s oxygen?",
    "They release oxygen as a waste-product of photosynthesis.",
    "Their net oxygen output is higher than that produced by all the trees and other land-based plants put together.",
    "Ancient algae are also the main constituent of oil and gas.",
    "Blue-green algae or cyanobacteria (from Greek kyanos – ‘dark greeny blue’) is Earth’s earliest known life form, with fossils that date back 3.6 billion years.",
    "While some algae are included with the plants in the Eukaryote domain ( eu , ‘true’, and karyon , ‘nut’, referring to their cells having true nuclei, which bacteria don’t), the cyanobacteria are now firmly in the Bacteria kingdom, with their own phylum.",
    "One form of cyanobacteria, spirulina, yields twenty times more protein per acre than soya beans.",
    "It consists of 70 per cent protein (compared with beef’s 22 per cent), 5 per cent fat, no cholesterol and an impressive array of vitamins and minerals.",
    "Hence the increasing popularity of the spirulina smoothie.",
    "It also boosts the immune system, particularly the production of protein interferons, the body’s front-line defence against viruses and tumour cells.",
    "The nutritional and health benefits of spirulina were recognised centuries ago by the Aztecs, sub-Saharan Africans and flamingos.",
    "Its significance for the future may be that algae can be grown on land that isn’t fertile, using (and recycling) brackish water.",
    "It’s a crop that doesn’t cause soil erosion, requires no fertilisers or pesticides and refreshes the atmosphere more than anything else that grows.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance &#160; &#160; &#160; What’s the most dangerous animal that has ever lived?",
    "&#160; &#160; Half the human beings who have ever died, perhaps as many as 45 billion people, have been killed by female mosquitoes (the males only bite plants).",
    "Mosquitoes carry more than a hundred potentially fatal diseases including malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, encephalitis, filariasis and elephantiasis.",
    "Even today, they kill one person every twelve seconds.",
    "Amazingly, nobody had any idea that mosquitoes were dangerous until the end of the nineteenth century.",
    "In 1877, the British doctor Sir Patrick Manson – known as ‘Mosquito’ Manson – proved that elephantiasis was caused by mosquito bites.",
    "Seventeen years later, in 1894, it occurred to him that malaria might also be caused by mosquitoes.",
    "He encouraged his pupil Ronald Ross, then a young doctor based in India, to test the hypothesis.",
    "Ross was the first person to show how female mosquitoes transmit the Plasmodium parasite through their saliva.",
    "To show that the theory worked for humans, he infected his own son – using mosquitoes carried in the diplomatic bag from Rome.",
    "(Fortunately, after an immediate dose of quinine, the boy recovered.) Ross won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1902.",
    "Manson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, knighted and founded the London School of Tropical Medicine.",
    "There are 2,500 known species of mosquito, 400 of them are members of the Anopheles family, and, of these, 40 species are able to transmit malaria.",
    "The females use the blood they suck to mature their eggs, which are laid on water.",
    "The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae or ‘wrigglers’.",
    "Unlike most insects, the pupae of mosquitoes, known as ‘tumblers’, are active and swim about.",
    "Male mosquitoes hum at a higher pitch than females: they can be sexually enticed by the note of a B-natural tuning fork.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance What were First World War German uniforms made from?",
    "During the First World War, both Germany and Austria ran short on supplies of cotton.",
    "In search of a suitable replacement, scientists chanced upon an ingenious solution: mixing very small quantities of cotton with nettles – specifically, the hardy fibres of the stinging nettle ( Urtica dioica ).",
    "Without any form of systematic production, the Germans cultivated 1.3 million kg of this material in 1915, and a further 2.7 million kg the following year.",
    "After a brief struggle, the British captured two German overalls in 1917, and their construction was analysed with some surprise.",
    "Nettles have many advantages over cotton for agriculture – cotton needs a lot of watering, it only grows in a warm climate, and requires a lot of pesticide treatment if it is to be grown economically.",
    "There’s no danger of being stung by a ‘full nettle jacket’ either, as the stinging hairs – little hypodermic syringes made of silica and filled with poison – are not used in production.",
    "The long fibres in the stems are all that are useful.",
    "The Germans were by no means the first to stumble across this plant’s many uses.",
    "Archaeological remains from around Europe reveal that it’s been used for tens of thousands of years for fishing nets, twine and cloth.",
    "The Bottle Inn, a pub in Marshwood, Dorset, England, holds an annual World Stinging Nettle Eating Championship.",
    "Rules are strict: no gloves, no mouth-numbing drugs (other than beer) and no regurgitation.",
    "The trick appears to be to fold the top of the nettle leaf towards you and push it past your lips before swigging it down with ale.",
    "The winner is the one who has the longest set of bare stalks at the end of an hour.",
    "The current record is 14.6 m (48 feet) for men, and about 8 m (26 feet) for women.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What sophisticated mechanism enabled the first successful landing on an aircraft carrier at sea?",
    "&#160; The human hand: the crew of the carrier simply reached up and pulled the plane down out of the air.",
    "The world’s first landing by an aeroplane on to a ship under way at sea was made on 2 August 1917 by Squadron Commander Edwin Harris Dunning, DSC , RN , in a Sopwith Pup on to the hanger roof of the converted battlecruiser HMS Furious .",
    "Dunning worked out that by combining the 40-knot stalling speed of the plane, the 21-knot top speed of the ship and a 19-knot wind he could hover relative to the ship.",
    "So, while Furious steamed into the wind, Dunning flew past it as close as possible, drifted round the bridge until he arrived over the roof of the hanger, side-slipped and pulled back on the throttle, allowing the plane to sink towards the deck.",
    "At this, a party of officers and men rushed out and grabbed the specially prepared ropes dangling from the plane and pulled it down on to the roof.",
    "Dunning completed a second landing in this way before deciding it was not a practical procedure.",
    "Five days later, he took off again, having given instructions that his plane was not to be touched until it had come to a complete standstill.",
    "But this time, when he arrived over the hanger, something went horribly wrong.",
    "Either he touched down and one of his tyres burst or he pulled back too hard on the throttle and the plane stalled.",
    "At any rate it swerved, the wind blew the aircraft over the side and the pilot was knocked unconscious and drowned.",
    "HMS Furious was one of a trio of battle cruisers built during World War I, the other two being the Courageous and the Glorious.",
    "Said to be the most ludicrous warships ever built for the Royal Navy, they were known throughout the Fleet as the Spurious , the Outrageous and the Uproarious .",
    "Furious was designed with two 46-cm (18-inch) gun turrets fore and aft.",
    "At the time, these were the largest guns in the world.",
    "The reference to the human hand as a ‘sophisticated mechanism’ is not intended to be sarcastic.",
    "In How The Mind Works , Stephen Pinker (noting that it was first pointed out by the Roman physician Galen 2,000 years ago) shows what an astonishing piece of engineering the human hand represents.",
    "Each one does the job of at least ten different tools.",
    "He names a hook grip (to lift a bucket); a scissor grip (to hold a cigarette); a five-jaw chuck (to lift a coaster); a three-jaw chuck (to hold a pencil); a two-jaw pad-to-pad chuck (to thread a needle); a two-jaw pad-to-side chuck (to turn a key); a squeeze grip (to hold a hammer); a disc grip (to open a jar); and a spherical grip (to hold a ball).",

    "Or place your hand on the table as if you were doing an impression of a spider with straight legs, tuck your middle finger under your hand and then try to lift each finger in turn.",
    "You’ll find that you can’t lift your ring finger, because the tendons in your fingers are all independent of each other, except for the one controlling the middle and ring fingers, which is shared between the two.",
    "An extreme pedant might point out that there are actually thousands of muscles in each finger, if you count the tiny retractors that cause your hairs to stand up or your blood vessels to contract, but these don’t move the fingers.",
    "A commonly repeated factoid is that the tongue is the strongest muscle in the human body.",
    "This is plain wrong, not least because the tongue comprises sixteen separate muscles, not one, but even taken together they aren’t the strongest, no matter which definition of strength one uses.",
    "The strongest muscle is either the largest (here the contenders are the gluteus maximus that makes up most of your buttocks or the quadriceps in your thigh) or the one that can exert most pressure on an object (which is your jaw muscle).",
    "However, probably the strongest ‘pound for pound’ muscle is the uterus: it weighs around 2 pounds (just under a kilogram) but during childbirth can exert a downward force of 400 Newtons, which is one hundred times as strong as gravity and equivalent to the power in a fully extended modern longbow.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Who discovered penicillin?",
    "&#160; &#160; Sir Alexander Fleming is a long way down the list.",
    "Bedouin tribesmen in North Africa have made a healing ointment from the mould on donkey harnesses for over a thousand years.",
    "In 1897, a young French army doctor called Ernest Duchesne rediscovered this by observing how Arab stable boys used the mould from damp saddles to treat saddle sores.",
    "He conducted thorough research identifying the mould as Penicillium glaucu m , used it to cure typhoid in guinea pigs and noted its destructive effect on E.",
    "It was the first clinically tested use of what came to be called penicillin.",
    "He sent in the research as his doctoral thesis, urging further study, but the Institut Pasteur didn’t even acknowledge receipt of his work, perhaps because he was only twenty-three and a completely unknown student.",
    "Army duties intervened and he died in obscurity in 1912 of tuberculosis – a disease his own discovery would later help to cure.",
    "Duchesne was posthumously honoured in 1949, five years after Sir Alexander Fleming had received his Nobel Prize for his re-rediscovery of the antibiotic effect of penicillin.",
    "He accidentally noticed the antibiotic properties of a mould which he identified as Penicillium rubrum .",
    "It was correctly identified many years later by Charles Thom as Penicillium notatum .",
    "The mould was originally named Penicillium because, under a microscope, its spore-bearing arms were thought to look like tiny paintbrushes.",
    "The Latin for a writer’s paintbrush is penicillum , the same word from which ‘pencil’ comes.",
    "In fact, what the mould cells of Penicillium notatum much more closely and spookily resemble is the hand-bones of a human skeleton.",
    "There is a picture of it here: http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/Toms_fungi/nov2003.html Stilton, Roquefort, Danish Blue, Gorgonzola, Camembert, Limburger and Brie all contain penicillin.",
    "&#160; &#160; Yes, ‘germ’ is an informal term for any biological agent that causes illness to its host and so covers both viruses and bacteria.",
    "Viruses are microscopic parasites too small to have cells or even their own metabolism.",
    "Each infected host cell becomes a factory capable of producing thousands of copies of the invading virus.",
    "The common cold, smallpox, AIDS and herpes are viral infections and can be treated by vaccination but not antibiotics.",
    "Bacteria are simple but cellular, the most abundant of all organisms.",
    "There are approximately 10,000 species living in or on the human body: a healthy human will be carrying ten times as many bacterial cells as human cells, and they account for about 10 per cent of dry body weight.",
    "The vast majority are benign, and many are beneficial.",
    "Bacterial illnesses include tetanus, typhoid fever, pneumonia, syphilis, cholera, food poisoning, leprosy, and tuberculosis and they are treatable with antibiotics.",
    "The word ‘germ’ comes from the Latin germen meaning sprout or bud.",
    "It was first used to describe a harmful microorganism in 1871 but it wasn’t until 1875 that Robert Koch finally demonstrated that anthrax was caused by a particular species of bacteria.",
    "Thirty-five years earlier, Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor had set up the first hygienic hospital ward in Vienna General Hospital.",
    "He noticed that the death rate of poor women attended by the nurse midwives was three times less than that of the wealthier women attended by the doctors.",
    "He concluded that this was a matter of cleanliness – the doctors used to go directly from the morgue to the obstetrics ward without washing their hands.",
    "When he presented his findings, his fellow doctors rejected his theory, unable to believe in what they could not see.",
    "In recent years, however, the hygiene itself has come under scrutiny.",
    "There seems to be evidence that indiscriminate use of anti-bacterial agents might have damaging side effects, allowing those bacteria that do survive to mutate into even more virulent strains.",
    "Also, our immune system, deprived of bacteria and parasites that it has struggled against for thousands of years, has a tendency to overreact leading to a sharp upswing in allergic diseases such asthma, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.",
    "Despite this, infectious diseases still kill more people than anything else and 80 per cent of those diseases are transmitted by touch.",
    "Most hygienists recommend that washing our hands regularly with good old-fashioned soap and water is the best and safest way to stay healthy.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What causes stomach ulcers?",
    "&#160; &#160; It’s not stress or spicy food Contrary to decades of medical advice to the contrary, it turns out that stomach and intestinal ulcers are not caused by stress or lifestyle but by bacteria.",
    "Ulcers are still relatively common, afflicting one in ten people.",
    "Napoleon and James Joyce both died from complications connected with stomach ulcers.",
    "In the early 1980s, two Australian pathologists, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, noticed that a previously unidentified bacterium colonised the bottom part of the stomachs of people who suffered from gastritis or ulcers.",
    "They cultivated it, gave it a name ( Helicobacter pylori ), and began to run trials.",
    "They found that when the bacteria were eliminated, the ulcers healed.",
    "Even today, most people still think that ulcers are caused by stress.",
    "The medical explanation was that stress diverted blood from the stomach, which reduced the production of its protective mucus lining.",
    "This gradually left the tissue beneath vulnerable to stomach acid and the result was an ulcer.",
    "What Marshall and Warren were proposing – that a common physiological condition, akin to a blister or a bruise, might actually be an infectious disease – was unprecedented in modern medicine.",
    "He drank a Petri dish full of the bacteria, and soon came down with a severe case of gastritis.",
    "He tested himself for the bacteria – his stomach was teeming with them – and then cured himself with a course of antibiotics.",
    "In 2005, Marshall and Warren were rewarded for their tenacity and vision, winning the Nobel Prize for Medicine.",
    "Helicobacter pylori is present in half the human population, and in almost everyone in developing countries.",
    "It is usually contracted in early childhood and can stay in the stomach for life.",
    "It only leads to ulcers in 10 to 15 per cent of those infected.",

    "They are about the size of a cat and squeak loudly when alarmed.",
    "Less appealingly, the bobac variety, found on the Mongolian steppe, is particularly susceptible to a lung infection caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis , commonly known as bubonic plague.",
    "They spread it around by coughing on their neighbours, infecting fleas, rats and, ultimately, humans.",
    "All the great plagues that swept through Eastern Asia to Europe came from marmots in Mongolia.",

    "It’s not as useless as you’ve been led to believe.",
    "The appendix is thought to be a remnant from the time when early humans ate grass.",
    "In other primates, such as gorillas and orang utans, the equivalent organ, known as the cecum or caecum (from the Latin for ‘blind’, as in ‘blind alley’ or dead end) is much larger and is used to digest the cellulose from the grass and leaves they eat.",
    "But the human appendix has other more practical uses.",
    "Lymphoid tissue (which helps protect the body from bacteria and other foreign invaders) begins to accumulate in the appendix shortly after you’re born and peaks in early adulthood.",
    "There is some evidence that the appendix also ‘trains’ our immune system by producing small amounts of dangerous antigens, which stimulate the production of protective antibodies.",
    "More recent research also points to it being a storage centre for helpful bacteria.",
    "Given the widespread prevalence of diarrhoea in the developing world (there are an estimated 1.4 billion cases a year), some researchers think its very shape and size make the appendix an ideal reservoir for repopulating the gut with essential bacteria after the disease has flushed the rest of the intestines clean.",
    "The appendix can also act as a backup in reconstructive surgery.",
    "It has been shown to be useful if a patient needs reconstruction of the bladder; it can be used as a substitute sphincter muscle or fashioned into a replacement ureter (the organ that connects the bladder to the kidneys).",

    "The foods that are worst for your teeth are hard-to-shift carbohydrates.",
    "Unlike sugars that dissolve quickly in your saliva, cooked starches, particularly potato products such as crisps, cling longer to the teeth, meaning that more acid is produced.",
    "Raisins are also particularly good at finding clefts and pits to hide in.",

    "It was then that a group of London ‘bards’ staged an entirely invented ceremony on Primrose Hill in London, involving a stone circle made from pebbles, and claimed they were reviving a ritual that stretched back to the ancient Celtic nation and its Druids.",
    "Prior to this, there is no record of the word ‘Celt’ having been used to describe the pre-Roman inhabitants of Britain or Ireland and it was certainly never a term they used to describe themselves.",
    "The word ‘Celt’ was coined by the Greek historian Herodotus in 450 BC when he described the peoples of the headwaters of the Danube north of the Alps.",
    "The Roman name for such people was Galli (‘chicken people’) and they called the inhabitants of the British Isles Britanni , never Celts.",
    "The use of the term ‘Celt’ in English dates from the seventeenth century.",
    "A Welsh linguist living in Oxford called Edward Lluyd noted the similarities between the languages spoken in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and Brittany.",

    "A single female can produce up to eighty offspring a year.",
    "Sudden surges in their numbers once led Scandinavians to think they were spontaneously generated by the weather.",
    "What actually happens is that mild winters lead to overpopulation that in turn leads to over-grazing.",
    "The lemmings set off into unfamiliar territory in search of food until they pile up against natural obstacles like cliffs, lakes and seas.",
    "A secondary myth has evolved which is that the whole idea of mass suicide was invented by the 1958 Walt Disney film White Wilderness .",
    "It was filmed in land-locked, lemming-free Alberta, Canada: the lemmings had to be bussed in from several hundred miles away in Manitoba.",
    "The shots of the ‘migration’ were made using a few lemmings on a snow-covered turntable.",
    "The notorious final scene – where lemmings plunge into the sea to the doom-laden voice-over of Winston Hibbler: ‘This is the last chance to turn back, yet over they go, casting themselves out bodily into space’ – was created by the film-makers simply throwing the lemmings into a river.",

    "Henry accompanied Magellan on all his subsequent voyages, including the round the world attempt which set off in 1519.",
    "This went in the other direction, across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, so when it arrived in the Far East in 1521, Henry became the first man to have been right round the world.",
    "No one knows where Henry the Black was born – he was probably captured and sold into slavery by Sumatran pirates as a child – but when he arrived in the Philippines, he found the locals spoke his native language.",
    "After Magellan’s death, the expedition continued on its way, successfully completing the circumnavigation under Juan Sebastián Elcano, the Basque second-in-command.",

    "&#160; &#160; Aristarchus of Samos, born 310 BC , a whole 1,800 years before Copernicus.",
    "Not only did Aristarchus suggest the Earth and planets travelled round the Sun, he also calculated the relative sizes and distances of the Earth, Moon and Sun and worked out that the heavens were not a celestial sphere, but a universe of almost infinite size.",
    "Aristarchus was most famous in his lifetime as a mathematician not an astronomer.",
    "We don’t know much about him, except that he studied at the Lyceum at Alexandria and is later mentioned by the Roman architect Vitruvius as a man who was ‘knowledgeable across all branches of science’.",
    "Only one of his works has survived, On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon .",
    "Unfortunately, it doesn’t mention his sun-centred theory.",
    "The reason we know about it at all is due to a single remark in one of Archimedes’ texts, which mentions Aristarchus’ theories only to disagree with them.",
    "Copernicus was certainly aware of Aristarchus because he credits him in the manuscript of his epoch-making On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres .",
    "However, when the book was printed in 1514, all mentions of the visionary Greek had been removed, presumably by the publisher, nervous of it undermining the book’s claims for originality.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Who invented the Theory of Relativity?",
    "The theory of relativity was first stated by Galileo Galilei in his Dialogue concerning the World’s Two Chief Systems in 1632.",
    "To understand relativity we need to understand the theory that it replaced.",
    "This was the theory of ‘absolute rest’ postulated by Aristotle in the fourth century BC which stated that rest was the natural state of any object and that an object would return to this state if left to its own devices.",
    "The theory of relativity says that the motion of all objects is relative to the motion of each other, and that to define one as being ‘at rest’ is simply a matter of convention.",
    "It follows from this that the speed of an object cannot be stated absolutely – only as ‘relative’ to something else.",
    "Galileo, the Italian astronomer and philosopher, was also one of the founders of modern physics.",
    "He is most famous for his support of the ‘Copernican’ (or Aristarchan) theory, that the Earth went round the Sun.",
    "The Catholic Church rounded smartly on him, but Galileo did not rot in a rat-infested cell for his principles.",
    "He began his sentence in the luxurious home of the Archbishop of Siena, before being taken back to a comfortable house arrest in his villa near Florence.",
    "It wasn’t until 1992 that the Catholic Church finally admitted that Galileo’s views on the solar system were correct.",
    "While Galileo may have been right about this, he was perfectly capable of making mistakes: his favourite argument for a moving Earth was that this movement caused the tides.",
    "He observed that the Mediterranean is more tidal than the Red Sea, and attributed this to the water being sloshed about by the Earth’s spin – which he said acted more strongly on the Mediterranean because it is aligned East-West.",
    "This argument was refuted by the eyewitness testimony of seafarers, who pointed out that there were two tides a day, not one as Galileo had assumed.",
    "Albert Einstein realised that Galileo had also made a mistake in his theory of relativity, or rather that the theory broke down in special circumstances.",
    "Einstein’s 1905 work, On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies , was the first to talk about the Special Theory of Relativity, which describes the strange properties of particles moving at close to the speed of light in a vacuum.",
    "The General Theory of Relativity, which applied the special theory to large-scale phenomena like gravity, was published ten years later in 1915.",

    "Despite his later reputation, his voyage of 1492 wasn’t intended to discover a new continent but to prove that Asia was much closer than anyone imagined.",
    "Columbus never actually set foot on mainland America – the closest he came was the Bahamas (probably the small island of Plana Cays) – but made his crew swear an oath that, if asked, they would say they’d reached India.",
    "He died in Valladolid in 1506 and remained convinced to the end that he’d reached the coast of Asia.",
    "There is a remarkable degree of uncertainty about Columbus.",
    "Most of the evidence points to him being the son of a Genoese weaver called Domenico Columbo, but there are enough inconsistencies for him to be claimed as Sephardic Jewish, Spanish, Corsican, Portuguese, Catalan or even Greek.",
    "He spoke the Genovese dialect (not Italian) as his first tongue and learnt to read and write in Spanish (with a marked Portuguese accent) and Latin.",
    "We don’t know what he looked like, as no authentic portrait survives, but his son claimed he was blond until the age of thirty, whereupon his hair turned completely white.",
    "We do know his corpse had its flesh removed, as was the style for the great and the good in the sixteenth century, and that his bones were interred first in Valladolid, then in the Carthusian monastery in Seville, then in Santa Domingo, Cuba, then Havana, then, and apparently finally, in Seville Cathedral in 1898.",
    "However, a casket with his name on remains in Santa Domingo and now Genoa and Pavia have also made competing claims to hold bits of him.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance What shape did medieval people think the Earth was?",
    "Since around the fourth century BC , almost no one, anywhere, has believed that the earth is flat.",
    "However, if you did want to show the earth as a flat disc, you’d end up with something very similar to the United Nations flag.",
    "Belief in a flat Earth may not even have actually originated until the nineteenth century.",
    "The guilty text was Washington Irving’s semi-fictional The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus (1828) which, incorrectly, suggests that Columbus’s voyage was made to prove the world was round.",
    "The idea of a flat earth was first seriously put forward in 1838 by the eccentric Englishman Samuel Birley Rowbotham who published a sixteen-page paper entitled: ‘Zetetic Astronomy: A Description of Several Experiments which Prove that the Surface of the Sea Is a Perfect Plane and that the Earth Is Not a Globe’ (‘Zetetic’ derives from the Greek zetein , meaning ‘to search, or inquire’).",
    "More than a century later, a member of the Royal Astronomical Society and devout Christian called Samuel Shenton re-branded the Universal Zetetic Society as the International Flat Earth Society.",
    "The NASA space programme of the 1960s, culminating in the lunar landings, should have buried the issue.",
    "Looking at photographs of a spherical earth taken from space, he commented: ‘It’s easy to see how a photograph like that could fool the untrained eye.’ The Apollo landings were, apparently, a Hollywood hoax, scripted by Arthur C.",
    "Shenton died in 1971 but not before choosing his successor as President of the Society.",
    "Johnson took over and made the Society a rallying point for a heroic, homespun ‘anti-Big Science’ movement.",
    "By the early 1990s, membership had surged to over 3,500.",
    "Johnson, who lived and worked in the vast flatness of the Mojave desert, proposed a world in which we live on a disc, with the North Pole at its centre, surrounded by a 150-foot-high perimeter wall of ice.",
    "The sun and moon are both 32 miles in diameter, and the stars are ‘about as far away as San Francisco is from Boston’.",
    "Johnson’s desert hideaway burnt down in 1995, destroying all the Society’s archives and membership lists.",
    "Johnson died in 2001, by which time the Society had shrunk to a few hundred members.",

    "This means they can actually learn and store information, despite having a brain 1.5 million times smaller than our own.",
    "Honeybees have an in-built ‘map’ of the sun’s movements across the sky over twenty-four hours and can modify this map to fit local conditions very quickly – all decisions about where to fly are made within five seconds.",
    "The honeybee is also more sensitive to the Earth’s magnetic field than any other creature.",
    "They use this for navigation and for making the honeycomb panels of their hives.",
    "If a strong magnet is put next to a hive under construction, a strange cylindrical comb results, unlike anything found in nature.",

    "A single bee would have to travel about 75,000 km (46,600 miles) to make a pound of honey (or less than half a kilo), which is almost twice round the world.",
    "Bees use their buzzing much as they use their movements, or ‘dancing’: to pass on information.",
    "Ten distinct sounds have been identified and some have been linked to specific activities.",
    "The most obvious of these uses is ‘fanning’ to cool the hive.",
    "It is loud and steady at about 250 beats per second, and is amplified by the hive itself.",
    "Bees also buzz more loudly to signal danger (anyone who has approached a hive will have noticed the change in tone) followed by a sequence of 500 beats per second pulses to sound the ‘all clear’ and calm the hive.",
    "The queen bee has a particularly rich range of sounds.",
    "When a new queen hatches she makes a high-pitched chirrup called ‘piping’ or ‘tooting’.",
    "Her sisters (still curled up inside their cells) answer with a croak-like call called ‘quarking’.",
    "This is a big mistake: there can only be one queen.",
    "Using the ‘quarks’ as a guide, the hatched queen picks each off in turn, tearing open their cells and either stinging them to death or ripping their heads off.",
    "Bees use their legs to hear: sound ‘messages’ in the hive are communicated through the intensity of the vibration.",
    "However, recent research into bees’ antennae suggest that as well as the chemical receptors they use to ‘smell’, the antennae are covered in eardrum-like plates, which might be ‘ears’.",
    "This would explain why other workers touch the dancing bee’s thorax with their antennae rather than the ‘waggling’ abdomen during the ‘waggle dance’ – they are hearing the directions to the nectar rather than seeing them.",
    "Until recently, the main theory was that they used the fourteen breathing holes along their sides (called ‘spiracles’) rather as a trumpeter controls the sound of his instrument with his lips.",
    "Entomologists at the University of California have ruled out this theory by carefully blocking the spiracles.",
    "The latest hypothesis is that buzzing is partly caused by the vibration of the wings, with some amplification from the thorax.",

    "On the other hand, a recent paper by Peter Lennie of the New York University Center for Neural Science indicates that the brain should ideally have no more than 3 per cent of neurons firing at any one time, otherwise the energy needed to ‘reset’ each neuron after it fires becomes too much for the brain to handle.",

    "No one has been able to find a precise source for the ‘space programme’ myth, except that the Apollo missions all depended on Teflon for cable insulation.",
    "Other myths about Teflon include the belief that Teflon-coated bullets are better at piercing body armour than other kinds; actually the Teflon coating is there to reduce the amount of wear on the inside of the rifle barrel, and has no bearing on the effectiveness of the bullet.",
    "Teflon does, however, have the lowest friction rating of any known solid material, which is why it works so well as a non-stick surface for frying pans.",
    "If it’s so slippery, how do they get it to stick to the pan?",
    "The process involves sandblasting to create tiny scratches on the pan’s surface, then spraying on a thin coat of liquid Teflon which flows into the scratches.",

    "Until the late 1960s, cathode-ray-tube television sets emitted extremely low levels of ultraviolet radiation and viewers were advised to sit no nearer than six feet from them.",
    "Their eyes are so good at accommodating changes in distance that they were able to sit and watch at a much closer range than most adults.",
    "Almost forty years ago, the Radiation Control for Health & Safety Act compelled all manufacturers to use leaded glass for their cathode-ray tubes, rendering television sets perfectly safe.",
    "The real damage caused by television is the lazy lifestyle it creates.",
    "Obesity rates among children in the UK have tripled in the last twenty years, and this has been linked to television.",
    "The average UK child aged between three and nine years old spends fourteen hours a week watching television and just over an hour playing sport or doing outdoor activities.",
    "A 2004 study in the journal Pediatrics concluded that children who watched two to three hours’ television a day had a 30 per cent higher chance of developing attention deficit disorder (ADD).",
    "In 2005, the research company Nielsen revealed that the average US home tuned in to eight hours of television per day.",
    "This is 12.5 per cent higher than ten years ago, and the highest level since television viewing figures were first measured in the 1950s.",
    "The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that by the time they reach the age of seventy, Americans will have spent an average of eight whole years watching television.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance How many galaxies are visible to the naked eye?",

    "Given that there are estimated to be more than 100 billion galaxies in the universe, each containing between 10 and 100 billion stars, it’s a bit disappointing.",
    "In total, only four galaxies are visible from Earth with the naked eye, only half of which can be seen at once (two from each hemisphere).",
    "In the Northern Hemisphere, you can see the Milky Way and Andromeda (M31), while in the Southern Hemisphere you can see the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.",
    "Some people with exceptional eyesight claim to be able to see three more: M33 in Triangulum, M81 in Ursa Major and M83 in Hydra, but it’s very hard to prove.",
    "The number of stars supposedly visible to the naked eye varies wildly, but everyone agrees that the total is substantially less than 10,000.",
    "Most amateur-astronomy computer software uses the same database: it lists 9,600 stars as ‘naked-eye visible’.",
    "Other estimates vary from around 8,000 down to fewer than 3,000.",

    "Unlike many creatures, humans don’t ‘imprint’ quickly.",
    "While mothers and fathers may form an immediate bond with their baby, it takes most babies between two and three months to show any strong preference for a particular human carer.",
    "Despite the homespun wisdom that says its essential to place a baby with its mother immediately after birth, this is probably more for the mother’s benefit than the baby’s.",
    "Research into the development of human attachments at the University of Minnesota in 1999 showed that the bonding process is much slower than most of us assume.",
    "It outlined the following steps: 16 hours babies prefer the sound of human language to other noises (at least, they start making rhythmic body movements, which psychologists assume means they’re excited).",
    "2 days babies can tell the difference between their mothers’ faces and that of a stranger, but they still appear to show no preference.",
    "3 days babies clearly prefer human voices, especially their mother’s.",
    "5 days babies clearly prefer the smell of their own mother’s milk.",
    "3–5 weeks babies become especially interested in faces, and particularly in their mother’s eyes.",
    "3–4 months babies start initiating social contact with their mother (or other primary carer).",
    "3–7 months babies start to show strong preferences for other members of their own family.",
    "&#160; The concept of ‘imprinting’ was made famous by the Austrian animal behaviourist Konrad Lorenz (1903–89), who demonstrated that greylag geese hatched in an incubator would bond with, or ‘imprint’ on, the first moving thing they saw within thirty-six hours of birth (in the original case, it was Lorenz’s Wellington boots).",
    "This fact has been used to great advantage in breeding&#160; programmes for endangered species of cranes, where their eggs are hatched and reared using hand puppets, humans in crane-costumes and taped calls.",
    "However, there is no evidence that humans imprint in the same way.",

    "Between 1990 and 2000, the number of prescriptions written for depression every year in the UK rose by more than ten million.",
    "It is estimated that depression costs the UK economy £ 8 billion a year through time off work, treatment costs, suicides and reduced productivity – equivalent to £ 160 a year for every man, woman and child.",
    "This is not just a function of innate British miserabilism or climate: 25 million Americans (9 per cent) are clinically depressed at any one time.",
    "In Australia, children as young as five are currently being treated for depression.",
    "In Bangladesh, by far the commonest illness is diarrhoea, followed by intestinal worm infections.",
    "But depression is widespread (particularly among women), running at about 3 per cent.",
    "In Africa, depression is the eleventh most common illness, HIV and malaria being first and second.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance Is the answer to depression just to ‘walk it off’?",
    "Recent research involving subjects aged twenty-four to forty-five found that half an hour’s exercise three to five times a week has the same (or better) effect on depression than drugs, regularly reducing symptoms by nearly 50 per cent.",
    "According to Science News , placebos are more effective at curing depression than either drugs or herbal remedies.",
    "In a series of trials carried out between 1979 and 1996, Seattle psychiatrist Dr Arif Khan found that St John’s Wort completely cured 24 per cent of cases, the anti-depressant drug Zoloft cured 25 per cent of cases, but the sugar-pill placebos effected a complete cure in 32 per cent of patients.",
    "In a more recent study comparing the anti-depressants Prozac and Efexor with placebos, the drugs won with a 52 per cent cure rate, but the placebos still scored impressively with 38 per cent.",

    "This is over 1,500 people: more than are killed by traffic accidents and twice as many as a decade ago.",
    "To put it in an international context Lithuanian suicides outstrip the British figure by six to one, the USA’s by five to one, and are almost three times the world average.",
    "Nobody knows why, but it is interesting that seven of the top ten suicide nations are Baltic states or other former members of the Soviet Union.",
    "Perhaps it’s because Lithuania also has the world’s highest density of neurologists.",
    "Across the world, including the Baltic, the people most likely to commit suicide are men (young and old) living in rural areas.",
    "This makes sense: anyone who’s spent time on a struggling farm knows that alcohol, isolation, debt, the weather and the inability to ask for help (known by psychologists as ‘helpless male’ syndrome), combined with proximity to firearms and dangerous chemicals, make a lethal combination.",
    "The exceptions are China and southern India where young women in rural areas are most at risk.",
    "In China this is thought to be because young brides are often left isolated by their new husbands, who immediately leave to work in the city.",
    "In India, self-immolation accounts for a third of all suicides by teenage girls.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance Which uses more muscles, smiling or frowning?",
    "&#160; Winsome greetings cards and unsolicited emails assure us that it takes many more muscles to frown than to smile – the idea being that you may as well cheer up and be happy, as it takes less effort than being a sourpuss.",
    "It actually takes one more muscle to smile than to frown.",
    "There are fifty-three muscles in the human face, twelve of which are needed for a nice big smile, while only eleven are needed to frown.",
    "A genuine smile is technically known as a Duchenne or zygomatic smile.",
    "The French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne (1806–75), who began his career electrocuting fishermen, was the first to prove that a sincerely warm smile uses the muscles of the eyes as well as the mouth, and the word zygomatic comes from the Greek zygoma , meaning ‘yoke’, after the two zygomatic muscles that run from each cheekbone to the corner of the mouth.",
    "As well as these four muscles, smiling takes two muscles to crinkle the eyes, two to pull up the corners of the lips, two to pull them sideways and two to curve the angle of the mouth.",
    "On the other hand, a frown needs two muscles to pull down the lips, three to furrow the brow, one to purse the lips, one to depress the lower lip, two to pull the mouth corners down and two eye crinklers.",
    "Despite all this, on balance it may still be easier to smile – largely because, in all but the most miserable cases, people smile much more often than they frown.",
    "As a result, our smiling muscles tend to be stronger.",
    "Incidentally, a cursory, insincere smile only needs two muscles.",
    "These are known as the risorius muscles (from the Latin for ‘laughter’) or Santorini’s muscles, after the Italian anatomist Giovanni Santorini (1681–1737) who discovered them, and they are responsible for pulling the corners of the mouth sideways.",
    "So, if your object is to fail to spread happiness with the absolute minimum of effort, a fake smile is easily your best bet.",

    "There is no evidence in his speeches or writings that he was ideologically sympathetic to vegetarianism, and not one of his lieutenants was a veggie.",

    "The idea that the Great Wall is the ‘only man-made object that can be seen from the moon’ is all-pervasive, but it confuses ‘the moon’ with space.",
    "It starts about 100 km (60 miles) from the Earth’s surface.",
    "From there, many artificial objects are visible: motorways, ships on the sea, railways, cities, fields of crops, and even some individual buildings.",
    "However, at an altitude of only a few thousand miles after leaving the Earth’s orbit, no man-made objects are visible at all.",
    "From the moon – over 400,000 km (some 250,000 miles) away – even the continents are barely visible.",

    "&#160; &#160; If you still think it’s Germany, you must have been living in a cave.",
    "The usual answer is Britain, because of their use of internment camps for families in the Second Boer War of 1899–1902.",
    "In their struggle to retain Cuba in 1895, they first came up with the idea of ‘concentrating’ civilians in one place to make them easier to control.",

    "The British translated the Spanish term, reconcentratión , when faced with a similar situation in South Africa.",
    "The camps had been made necessary by the British policy of burning down Boer farms.",
    "The British decided to round up all the women and children left behind by the Boer troops, to stop them resupplying the enemy.",
    "In total, there were forty-five tented camps for Boer women and children and sixty-four for black African farm labourers and their families.",
    "Despite the humane intentions, conditions in the camps quickly degenerated.",
    "There was very little food, and disease spread rapidly.",
    "By 1902, 28,000 Boers (including 22,000 children) and 20,000 Africans had died in the camps – twice as many as the soldiers killed in the fighting.",
    "Shortly after this, the Germans also established their first concentration camps in their attempts to colonise South-West Africa (now Namibia).",
    "Men, women and children of the Herero and Namaqua peoples were arrested and imprisoned and forced to work in camps.",

    "Germany, however, was divided between the Western powers and the USSR, and no peace treaty was signed with what emerged as the German Democratic Republic in 1949.",
    "So, the first celebration of German reunification on 3 October 1990 marks the official end to World War II.",
    "The United States has formally declared war just eleven times: twice against Germany, twice against Hungary (1917, in its guise as Austria-Hungary, and 1942) and once each against Romania (1942), Bulgaria (1942), Italy (1941), Japan (1941), Spain (1898), Mexico (1898) and the United Kingdom (1812).",
    "The Vietnam War and the two Iraq campaigns were not formal declarations of war, but ‘military engagements authorized by Congress’.",
    "Under the 1973 War Powers Act, the President gained authority to deploy troops (within certain limits of size and time) without a formal declaration.",
    "Formal declarations are disliked because they lend legitimacy to unrecognised or unpopular regimes.",
    "The Korean War was neither formally declared nor approved by Congress and, despite hostilities ending in 1953, a peace treaty has never been signed with North Korea.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance Who was the most dangerous American in history?",
    "It was probably Thomas Midgely, a chemist from Dayton, Ohio, who invented both CFCs and lead in gasoline.",
    "Early in his career he discovered by chance that adding iodine to kerosene slightly reduced ‘knocking’ in engines.",
    "So he taught himself chemistry from scratch and, over six years, worked through the entire periodic table looking for the perfect solution.",
    "By then, the company he worked for had merged with General Motors who eagerly began adding his completely ‘knock-free’ answer to fuel for car engines.",
    "But it was also toxic, and pumped billions of tons of lead into the atmosphere over seven decades, poisoning thousands of people – including Midgely himself (though he always denied it).",
    "Some think it was Midgely’s guilt over lead gasoline that motivated him to develop a safe alternative to the noxious chemicals like sulphur dioxide and ammonia which were used in refrigeration.",
    "His discovery of dichloroflouromethane – the first of the Freons – took three days.",
    "CFCs seemed like the perfect solution – inert, non-toxic, beneficial.",
    "Unfortunately, we now know they destroy the ozone layer and, since 1987, their production has been banned internationally.",
    "By any standard, Midgely was an extraordinary man.",
    "He held 171 patents, loved music and wrote poetry.",
    "At fifty-one he contracted polio and lost the use of his legs.",
    "In a final irony, the harness he designed to help him get in and out bed got tangled one morning and in the ensuing struggle, America’s most dangerous man inadvertently strangled himself.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance What valuable commodity gives the US the legal right to seize foreign territory?",
    "In the 1850s, American farmers were so desperate for fertiliser that they were reduced to putting hair, feathers and soot on their over-farmed soil to increase the yields of wheat, cotton and tobacco.",
    "Bird dung, rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, and known as guano (from a Quechua Indian word meaning ‘the droppings of sea-birds’) looked like the answer.",
    "The discovery of massive deposits off the coast of Peru in the early nineteenth century set off a guano rush, which enabled the Peruvian government to charge huge prices for it.",
    "The American response was to pass a special bill through Congress in 1856 called the Guano Islands Act.",
    "This granted mining rights to any US citizen who hoisted the stars and stripes on any previously unclaimed, guano-laden island.",
    "Almost a hundred Pacific and Caribbean islands were acquired in this way, including Christmas and Midway Island.",
    "The scene of one of the most notorious ‘guano-snatches’ was the island of Navassa, near Haiti.",
    "Now uninhabited except for giant iguanas and goats the size of ponies (left by seventeenth-century pirates), in the late nineteenth century, it was home to the notorious Navassa Phosphate Company where, in 1899, four white overseers were killed by black miners rioting against appalling working conditions.",
    "The discovery of this shameful pocket of slavery caused outrage among liberal Americans and some historians credit the Navassa Riot with kick-starting the modern American labour movement.",
    "Navassa is still subject to a formal claim by Haiti – the last US territory to be claimed by a foreign nation.",
    "Guano is the product of billions of anchovies ( Engraulis ringens ) that live in gigantic shoals off the coast of Peru, the largest fish resource by weight in the world.",
    "It feeds the planet’s largest bird colony: ten million boobies, cormorants, gulls and penguins that feed on the anchovies.",
    "Their droppings produce such a powerful fertiliser that the Incas ranked it alongside gold as a gift from the gods, allotting the death penalty for anyone who molested the birds that made it.",
    "In the 1860s, guano accounted for 75 per cent of Peru’s total revenue.",
    "At the time the Guano Islands Act was passed, the Peruvian President, Rámon Castilla (1797–1867) was earning twice as much as Franklin Pierce (1804–69), his American counterpart.",
    "Even though the guano rush is long over, anchovy fishmeal is still Peru’s biggest export, much of it going to China to feed chickens.",

    "The Spitfire was a more advanced design, faster, lighter to handle and capable of operating at altitudes of up to 30,000 feet.",
    "But the records clearly show that the heavy fighting in the Battle of Britain was done by the Hawker Hurricane.",
    "In 1940, Hurricane squadrons outnumbered Spitfire squadrons by three to two; 1,715 Hurricanes were used in the battle, more than all the other RAF aircraft put together.",
    "Mason’s exhaustive account, Battle over Britain (1969), he shows that of 11,400 reported engagements, Hurricanes accounted for 55 per cent of all kills, to the Spitfires’ 33 per cent.",
    "In general, the Hurricanes specialised in attacking bombers, while the Spitfires took the fighters.",
    "However, the highest-scoring RAF pilot in the battle, Sergeant Josef František (a Czech), only flew Hurricanes and still managed to down nine Me 109s – the fastest and best-equipped German fighter – among his total of seventeen enemy aircraft.",
    "The first Hawker Hurricane flew in 1935 and was basically a single-winged Hawker Fury, one of the most reliable of the biplanes designed for Hawker between the wars by Sydney Camm.",
    "Hurricanes were built from 1937 to 1944 on a steel frame with a linen fabric covering.",
    "The Hurricane was cheap to make and easy to repair.",
    "Its fabric skin meant bullets could pass right through, and on more than one occasion Hurricanes returned safely with large pieces of wing missing.",
    "Hurricanes could be turned around more quickly for battle, absorbed the shudder of eight guns rather better than Spitfires and, because the cockpits were larger, fighter pilots could wrap up warmer.",
    "Spitfires scored their first kills for the RAF in September 1939 when they inadvertently shot down some of their own Hurricanes.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance When did the last survivor of the Crimean War die?",
    "The last veteran of the Crimean War, which ended in 1856, was Timothy, a Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise.",
    "He was thought to be approximately 160 years old at the time of his death, and the UK’s oldest known resident.",
    "Timothy was found aboard a Portuguese privateer in 1854 by Captain John Courtenay Everard of the Royal Navy and served as a mascot on a series of Navy vessels until 1892, including service as ship’s mascot of HMS Queen during the first bombardment of Sebastopol in the Crimean War.",
    "He then retired to Powderham Castle, where he was taken in by Everard’s relative, the tenth Earl of Devon.",
    "Timothy had the Devon’s family motto – ‘Where have I fallen?",
    "During the Second World War, he left the shade of his favourite wisteria and dug his own air-raid shelter under the terrace steps.",
    "Lady Gabrielle Courtenay, aunt to the current Earl and Timothy’s keeper, claimed this was because the vibration from bombs falling on nearby Exeter had disturbed him.",
    "She also believed he could recognise people’s voices, and always came when called.",
    "After the war, he returned to the same rose-bed to hibernate every year, wearing a large tag marked ‘My name is Timothy – I am very old.",
    "Please do not pick me up.’ According to Rory Knight-Bruce, Timothy’s biographer, the few who were allowed to carry him ‘would have held a doughty veteran with a gimlet eye whose density of weight was about that of a medium-sized Le Creuset pot.’ In 1926, the Devons decided that Timothy should mate.",
    "It was then discovered that Timothy was actually female.",
    "Given her age, they decided against changing his/her name, and although they did introduce a potential mate called Toby, she died without an heir.",
    "Timothy was buried in the family burial plot in the castle grounds.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance How many dog years equal one human year?",
    "No reliable authority can be found to help us make simple cross-species age comparisons.",
    "Some twelve-year-old cats and dogs have a much higher level of physical capability than even the most sprightly eighty-four-year-old human and there does seem to be significant variation between different breeds.",
    "The best that can be done is to apply a widely accepted approximate formula which suggests that kittens and puppies mature much faster than babies, with the rate of ageing slowing down significantly after two years.",
    "Therefore, a one-year-old cat might be roughly sixteen in human years, while a four-year-old could be compared to a man or woman of thirty-two, an eight-year-old to a sixty-four-year-old and so on.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Which of these are Chinese inventions?",
    "&#160; &#160; a ) Glass b ) Rickshaws c ) Chop suey d ) Fortune cookies &#160; Chop suey.",
    "There are many fanciful stories about its American origin but it is a Chinese dish.",
    "Anderson’s definitive The Food of China (1988), chop suey is named as a dish local to Toisan in southern Canton.",
    "They called it tsap seui, which means ‘miscellaneous scraps’ in Cantonese.",
    "Most of the early immigrants to California came from this region, hence its early appearance in America.",
    "Glass isn’t Chinese: the earliest-known glass artefacts are from ancient Egypt in 1350 BC .",
    "The earliest Chinese porcelain dates from the Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220).",
    "Ancient China built a whole culture on porcelain, but they never got to grips with transparent glass.",
    "This is sometimes used to explain the fact that they never had a scientific revolution comparable with the one in the West, which was made possible by the development of lenses and transparent glassware.",
    "The rickshaw was invented by an American missionary, Jonathan Scobie, who first used it to wheel his invalid wife through the streets of Yokohama in Japan in 1869.",
    "Fortune cookies are also American, though they were probably invented by a Japanese immigrant, Makato Hagiwara, a landscape designer who created the Golden Gate tearoom in San Francisco.",
    "He served small, sweet Japanese buns with thank-you notes inside from about 1907 onwards.",
    "Restaurant owners in the city’s Chinatown copied them and the notes soon started to tell fortunes.",
    "PHILL Was the rickshaw invented by a bloke called Rick Shaw ?",
    "A day is a single rotation of the earth about its axis.",
    "Astonishingly, it can be as much as fifty whole seconds longer or shorter.",
    "This is because the speed of the Earth’s rotation is continually changing as result of friction caused by tides, weather patterns and geological events.",
    "Over a year, an average day is a fraction of a second shorter than twenty-four hours.",
    "Once atomic clocks had recorded these discrepancies, the decision was made to redefine the second, hitherto a set fraction of the ‘solar’ day – i.e.",
    "an eighty-six-thousand-and-four-hundredth of a day.",
    "The new second was launched in 1967 and defined as: ‘the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.’ Accurate, but not easy to say when tired at the end of a long day.",
    "This new definition of a second means that the solar day is gradually drifting away from the atomic day.",
    "As a result, scientists have introduced a ‘leap second’ into the atomic year, to bring it into line with the solar year.",
    "The last ‘leap second’ added (the seventh since Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) was established in 1972) was on 31 December 2005, on the instruction of the International Earth Rotation Service based at the Paris Observatory.",
    "That’s good news for astronomers and those of us who want our watches to correspond to the movement of the Earth around the Sun, but bad news for computer software and all technology based on satellites.",
    "The idea was vigorously opposed by the International Telecommunication Union who made a formal proposal to abandon the leap second by December 2007.",
    "One compromise might be to wait until the discrepancy between UTC and GMT reaches an hour (in about 400 years time) and adjust it then.",
    "In the meantime, the debate about what constitutes the ‘real’ time continues.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What’s the longest animal?",
    "The bootlace worm, Lineus longissimus , reaches lengths of sixty metres (that’s just under 200 feet), almost twice as long as a blue whale and a third longer than the longest lion’s mane jellyfish, the previous record holder.",
    "You could drape a bootlace worm from one end of an Olympic swimming pool to the other and still have some spare.",
    "Bootlace worms, also known as ribbon worms, belong to the Nemertea worm family (Nemertea comes from the Greek Nemertes , a sea-nymph).",
    "There are more than a thousand species, most of them aquatic.",
    "They are long and thin: even the longest may be only a few millimetres in diameter.",
    "Many sources claim the bootlace worm only reaches 30 metres (nearly 100 feet) in length, which is not quite as long as the lion’s mane jellyfish.",
    "But the latest information reveals that their capacity to stretch is extraordinary.",
    "Several have been found that are over 50 metres (165 feet) when fully extended.",
    "Fossil evidence shows they have been around for at least 500 million years.",
    "Bootlace worms have no hearts – their blood is pumped by their muscles – and they are the simplest organisms to have a separate mouth and anus.",
    "They are voracious carnivores, shooting out a long thin tube which is sticky or armed with poisonous hooks, to skewer and stun small crustaceans.",
    "This can be three times as long as the worm’s own body.",
    "Most ribbon worms lurk in the murk of the ocean bottom but some are incredibly brightly coloured.",
    "But some bootlace species actually reproduce by fragmenting into small pieces, each of which becomes a new worm.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What happens if you cut an earthworm in half?",
    "&#160; You get two halves of a dead worm, usually.",
    "Sometimes the head end survives, but you can’t get two worms from one.",
    "Some species of worm can regenerate amputated tails, depending on how many body segments they’ve lost, and some species jettison tails to escape predators, but the headless part will always die, as will the head if it hasn’t retained sufficient body.",
    "The death throes of the severed sections can go on for hours, and could easily be mistaken for lively wriggling.",
    "The ‘both ends become a worm’ idea seems to have started as a way of shutting up small children.",
    "Sadly, nobody ever gets round to telling you that it isn’t true once you’ve grown up.",
    "The smooth band a third of the way along an earthworm isn’t the ‘join’ from which the ‘new worm’ grows.",
    "It is called the clitellum and is responsible for secreting the sticky clear mucus that covers the worm.",
    "There is a freshwater flatworm called a planaria or ‘cross-eyed worm’ which also has an extraordinary ability to regenerate itself when damaged.",
    "Morgan (1866–1945) found that a piece of planaria 1/279th of its original size could regenerate into a full-sized planaria, and a planaria split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What’s the loudest thing in the ocean?",
    "Though the blue whale produces the loudest noise of any individual animal in the sea or on land, the loudest natural noise of all is made by shrimps.",
    "The sound of the ‘shrimp layer’ is the only natural noise that can ‘white out’ a submarine’s sonar, deafening the operators through their headphones.",
    "Below the layer they can hear nothing above it and vice versa.",
    "Hearing from below can only be accomplished by raising a mast up through it.",
    "The noise of the collected shrimps amounts to an ear-splitting 246 decibels, which even adjusting for the fact that sound travels five times faster in water, equates to about 160 decibels in air: considerably louder than a jet taking off (140 dB) or the human threshold of pain.",
    "Some observers have compared it to everyone in the world frying bacon at the same time.",
    "The noise is caused by trillions of shrimps snapping their single oversized claw all at once.",
    "Snapping shrimps, members of the various Alpheus and Synalpheus species, are found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters.",
    "Video shot at 40,000 frames per second shows clearly that the noise occurs 700 microseconds after the claw has snapped shut.",
    "The noise comes from burst bubbles – not the shutting of the claw itself – an effect known as ‘cavitation’.",
    "A small bump on one side of the claw fits neatly into a groove on the other side.",
    "The claw is shut so rapidly that a jet of water travelling at 100 kilometres (62 miles) per hour squirts out, fast enough to create expanding bubbles of water vapour.",
    "When the water slows down and normal pressure is restored the bubbles collapse creating intense heat (as high as 20,000 °C), a loud pop and light – this last being a very rare phenomenon called sonoluminescence, where sound generates light.",
    "Shrimps use this noise to stun prey, communicate and find mates.",
    "As well as ruining sonar, the sharp, hot intense noise makes dents in ships’ propellers.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Why are flamingos pink?",
    "&#160; &#160; Because they eat a lot of blue-green algae.",
    "Flamingos do eat shrimps, but the colour of the birds comes from the algae.",
    "Despite their name, blue-green algae can be red, violet, brown, yellow or even orange.",
    "Like flamenco , the word comes from the Latin for ‘flame’.",
    "The red and white flag of Peru was inspired by them.",
    "They are at least ten million years old and once ranged over Europe, America and Australia.",
    "Now they live in isolated pockets of Africa, India, South America and southern Europe.",
    "They lay only one egg a year which is balanced on a mound of soil.",
    "Both parents take turns to incubate it and both produce bright red, highly nutritious ‘milk’ from their throats, which the chicks feed on for their first two months.",
    "Flamingos are one of only two kinds of bird to produce milk: the other is pigeons.",
    "In captivity, flamingos that are not parents will spontaneously produce milk if they hear the cries of chicks.",
    "After leaving the nest, flamingos live in vast crèches.",
    "Though these may contain more than 30,000 birds, the young flamingo is fed only by its parents, who recognise it by its cry.",
    "Unlike other birds, they filter their food in the same way as whales and oysters.",
    "Their beaks are lined with rows of plates that sift items from the water.",
    "The lesser flamingo ( Phoeniconaias minor ) has such a dense filter it can strain single-celled plants less than 0.05 mm ( inch) in diameter.",
    "The flamingo’s tongue acts as a pump, pushing water through its beak four times a second.",
    "Pliny the Elder recommended eating flamingo tongue as a tasty delicacy.",
    "Flamingos sleep on one leg, with one half of their body at a time – like dolphins – while the other remains alert for predators.",
    "They inhabit inhospitable lakes that have high levels of salt and soda, where the water is undrinkable by other animals and nothing grows.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What colour is a panther?",
    "&#160; &#160; There is no such thing as ‘a’ panther.",
    "The word probably comes from the Sanskrit for whitish-yellow, pandarah , which was originally applied to the tiger.",
    "The Greeks borrowed the word and adapted it as panthera , meaning ‘all beasts’.",

    "Scientifically speaking, all four of the largest species of big cat are panthers.",
    "The lion is Panthera leo; the tiger, Panthera tigris, the leopard, Panthera pardus and the jaguar Panthera onca .",
    "The animals that most people think of as panthers are, in fact, either black leopards (in Africa or Asia), or black jaguars (in South America).",
    "Close examination shows that their spots are still faintly visible on their skin.",
    "They carry a genetic mutation that means the black pigment in their fur dominates the orange.",
    "Rare ‘white panthers’ are in fact albino leopards or jaguars.",
    "In the USA, when people say ‘panther’ they mean a black puma.",
    "Despite many unproven reports and supposed sightings, no one has ever found one.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What makes an animal see red?",
    "&#160; &#160; The myth that bulls are infuriated by the colour red has been around since at least 1580, when the best-selling writer of the time, John Lyly, noted that: ‘He that commeth before an Elephant will not wear bright colors, nor he that commeth to a Bul, red.’ The fact is that, like rats, hippos, owls and aardvarks, bulls are colour-blind.",
    "It is the movements of the bullfighter’s cape that cause the bull to charge; the colour is merely for the benefit of the crowd.",
    "Dogs can distinguish between blue and yellow, but can’t tell green from red.",
    "At traffic lights, guide dogs decide whether it is safe to cross by listening to the traffic.",
    "Hence the peeping sounds on modern pedestrian crossings.",
    "The creatures that have really strong views on red are chickens.",
    "Poultry farmers know only too well the practical problems of a chicken ‘seeing red’.",
    "When one of them bleeds, the others peck at it obsessively.",
    "This cannibalistic behaviour, if unchecked, can lead to a killing spree and a rapid reduction in the farmer’s flock.",
    "The traditional solution is to trim the chickens’ beaks with a hot knife so they are blunt and cause less damage.",
    "However, in 1989 a company called Animalens launched red-tinted contact lenses for egg-laying chickens.",
    "The early results were promising – because everything looked red, the chickens fought less and needed less feed because they weren’t so active, but still laid the same number of eggs.",
    "The egg industry operates on a tiny profit margin of about 1.6 per cent.",
    "There are 250 million egg-layers in the USA, 150 million of them on just fifty farms.",
    "Red contact lenses for chickens promised a tripling in profits.",
    "Unfortunately, fitting the lenses was fiddly and labour-intensive.",
    "Deprived of oxygen, the chickens’ eyes degenerated rapidly, causing pain and distress.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance Where did Marco Polo come from?",
    "Marco Polo (or ‘Mark Chicken’ in English) was born Marko Pilić in Korcula, Dalmatia, in 1254, then a protectorate of Venice.",
    "We shall probably never know whether he really went to the Far East as a seventeen-year-old with his merchant uncles or if he simply recorded the tales of Silk Road traders who stopped off at their Black Sea trading post.",
    "What is certain is that his famous book of travels was largely the work of a romance writer called Rustichello da Pisa with whom he shared a cell after being captured by the Genoans in 1296.",
    "Polo dictated it; Rustichello wrote it in French, a language Polo didn’t speak.",
    "The result, which appeared in 1306, was designed to entertain, and it became a best-seller in the era before printing.",
    "Its original title was Il Milione – ‘the Million’ – for reasons that are now obscure, although it quickly became nicknamed ‘the million lies’, and Polo – now a rich and successful merchant – was known as ‘Mr Million’.",
    "It was probably just a catchy thirteenth-century version of a title like ‘Wonder Book of Wonders’.",
    "Marco Polo is also supposed to have brought pasta and ice cream to Italy.",
    "In fact, pasta was known in Arab countries in the ninth century and dried macaroni is mentioned in Genoa in 1279, twenty-five years before Polo claimed to have returned.",
    "According to the food historian Alan Davidson, the myth itself only dates back as far as 1929 when it was mentioned in an American pasta-trade journal.",
    "Ice cream may well be a Chinese invention but it seems unlikely to have been introduced to the West by Polo, as it doesn’t get mentioned again until the middle of the seventeenth century.",

    "Dahl described them as a tribe of 3,000 black pygmies imported by Mr Wonka from ‘the very deepest and darkest part of the African jungle where no white man had been before’, to replace the sacked white workers in his factory.",
    "They lived on chocolate, whereas before they had only eaten ‘beetles, eucalyptus leaves, caterpillars and the bark of the bong-bong tree.’ Although it was well received at the time, Dahl’s description of the Oompa-Loompas, with its overtones of slavery, veered dangerously close to racism and, by the early 1970s, his US publishers Knopf insisted on changes.",
    "In 1972, a revised edition of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory appeared.",
    "Out went the black pygmies, in came Oompa-Loompas looking like small hippies with long ‘golden-brown hair’ and ‘rosy-white skin’.",
    "Later, Dahl’s illustrator Quentin Blake depicted them as multicoloured futuristic punks with Mohawk hairdos.",
    "The two Hollywood films in 1971 and 2005 made the Oompa-Loompas look like orange elves.",
    "Dahl hated the 1971 film, not least because the (uncredited) screenwriter David Seltzer (later to write The Omen ) had Wonka spouting poetic quotations that weren’t in the book.",
    "The film’s title was changed to Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory allegedly because ‘Charlie’ had become US street slang for an African American.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance What colour were Robin Hood’s tights?",
    "The earliest Robin Hood stories were ballads dating from the fifteenth century.",
    "In the longest and most important of these, A Gest of Robyn Hode , Robin and his ‘mery men’ wear ‘a good mantell of scarlet and raye’, a kind of striped bright red wrap.",
    "In other ballads, Robin wears red or scarlet while his men wear green.",
    "This reflects his status as leader – ‘scarlet’ was the most expensive cloth in medieval England, dyed using kermes, the dried bodies of the female shield louse ( Kermes ilicis ).",
    "This also explains the name Robin – associated with the robin redbreast – and that of one of his closest associates: Will Scarlet.",
    "It is only in later versions that ‘Lincoln Green’ becomes the colour for the outlaws’ gear but even this may not have been green.",
    "Lincoln was the capital of the medieval English dyeing industry.",
    "‘Lincoln Green’ was green (blue dye made from woad was over-dyed with yellow) but ‘Lincoln Grain’ was scarlet, dyed with kermes, known as ‘graine’.",
    "The early Robin Hood stories are obsessed by clothing.",
    "As well as Robin being named after his headgear, mantles, kirtles, coats, breeches, shirts and six different colours of cloth are mentioned in the Ges t , and at one point Robin plays at being a draper, selling the King 123 feet of green cloth.",
    "This has prompted the idea that the ballads may have been written for the Livery Guilds, companies of merchants involved in manufacturing.",
    "Many of them were founded at the time the Gest was written ( c .1460); their preferred style of uniform was a coloured hood.",
    "At least one historian has suggested that the real point of the Robin Hood stories is not the traditional ‘forest versus town’ or ‘rich versus poor’ battle, but the victory of the merchant adventurer over the failing, corrupt nobility.",
    "Robin Hood, dressed in expensive red cloth, was really the champion of the emerging middle classes rather than the poor.",

    "Distinguished Gorringes include: General George Frederick Gorringe (1865–1945), the unpopular British First World War commander; Harry Gorringe, the first-class Australian cricketer; and Henry Honeychurch Gorringe, the man who brought Cleopatra’s Needle from Egypt to New York’s Central Park.",
    "In 1673, New York was called New Orange (so the New Orange became the Big Apple).",
    "The city was founded by the Dutch in 1653 as New Amsterdam, taken by the English in 1664 and renamed New York, and retaken by the Dutch in 1673 and named New Orange.",
    "Under the Treaty of Westminster in 1674 the city was ceded to the English, and New York became its permanent name.",
    "The word ‘orange’ is a good example of what linguists call wrong word division.",
    "It derives from the Arabic naranj and arrived in English as ‘narange’ in the fourteenth century, gradually losing the initial ‘n’.",
    "The same process left us with apron (from naperon ) and umpire (from noumpere ).",
    "Sometimes it works the other way round, as in nickname (from an eke-name, meaning ‘also-name’) or newt (from an ewt).",

    "The earliest evidence of carrots being used by humans dates from 3,000 BC in Afghanistan.",
    "These original carrots were purple on the outside and yellow on the inside.",
    "The ancient Greeks and Romans cultivated the vegetable, but mostly for medicinal purposes: the carrot was considered a powerful aphrodisiac.",
    "Galen, the famous second-century Roman physician, on the other hand, recommended carrots for expelling wind.",
    "He was the first to identify them as separate from their close relative the parsnip.",
    "As Arab traders spread carrot seed through Asia, Africa and Arabia carrots blossomed into different shades of purple, white, yellow, red, green and even black.",
    "The very first orange carrot was grown in sixteenth-century Holland, patriotically bred to match the colour of the Dutch Royal House of Orange.",
    "By the seventeenth century, the Dutch were the main European producers of carrots and all modern varieties are descended from their four orange ones: Early Half Long, Late Half Long, Scarlet and Long Orange.",
    "There is currently a vogue for non-orange carrots: white, yellow, dark red and purple varieties are available in the shops.",
    "In 1997, Iceland developed a chocolate-flavoured carrot as part of their child-focused Wacky Veg range.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance Do carrots help us see in the dark?",
    "Carrots are a good source of vitamin A, a deficiency of which can lead to night blindness, where the eye adapts very slowly to changes in light.",
    "The retina of the eye is made up of light-sensitive cells called rods and cones.",
    "Cones pick up detail and colour, but need plenty of light to function (like a ‘slow’ film emulsion).",
    "The rods can’t distinguish colour at all but need less light (like a ‘fast’ emulsion) so are used for night vision.",
    "They contain a light-sensitive chemical called rhodopsin, the key ingredient of which is vitamin A.",
    "The easiest way to treat night blindness is to increase the intake of vitamin A, most commonly found in carotene.",
    "Carrots contain carotene, but even better are apricots, dark-leaved vegetables such as spinach, and bilberries.",
    "But improving defective night vision is very different from making normal night vision better.",
    "Eating lots of carrots won’t help you see any better in the dark – all it will do, over time, is to turn your skin orange.",
    "During the Second World War, Group Captain John Cunningham (1917–2002) gained the nickname ‘Cats Eyes Cunningham’.",
    "The British government encouraged rumours that he was able see in the dark because he ate so many carrots.",
    "This was deliberate disinformation designed to cover up the fact that he was testing the newly developed (and top secret) airborne radar system.",
    "It seems highly unlikely the Germans were taken in, but it helped persuade a generation of British children to eat the one vegetable that remained in constant supply through the war.",
    "The Government started to overdo the carrot propaganda.",

    "The world’s largest drupe is the coconut, which, because of its hard flesh, is called a ‘dry drupe’.",
    "Strawberries, raspberries and blackberries are called ‘aggregated’ drupes because each individual fruit is actually a cluster of miniature drupes – the characteristic bumply bits which make up blackberries and raspberries.",
    "Each one of these drupelets contains a single tiny seed – these are the bits that get stuck in your teeth when you eat a blackberry.",
    "Tomatoes, oranges, lemons, grapefruit, watermelons, kiwi fruit, cucumbers, grapes, passion fruit, papaya, peppers and bananas are all berries.",

    "It refers to the ancient custom of picking bunches (knots) of flowers on May Day to celebrate the end of winter, or ‘to go a-maying’.",
    "May, the blossom of the hawthorn, is the only British flower to be named after the month in which it blooms.",
    "The may-tree is the origin of both the maypole and the phrase ‘Ne’er cast a clout before May is out’ – which refers not to the ending of the month, but to the opening of the flowers.",
    "Though the may-tree is closely associated with May Day, it blossoms in the middle of the month not at the beginning of it.",
    "This is due to the change to the Gregorian calendar in 1752.",
    "Before this, May Day would have occurred eleven days later, exactly the time when the may-tree breaks into flower.",
    "It is considered extremely unlucky to bring hawthorn flowers inside the house, a superstition more widely believed for may than for any other species of plant in the British Isles.",
    "There are many possible reasons for this but the most convincing is to do with its smell.",
    "Hawthorn flowers have a heavy, complicated scent, the distinctive element of which is triethylamine, which is also one of the first chemicals produced by a dead human body when it starts to decay.",
    "In some areas it is still referred to as ‘the smell of the Great Plague’ and people who know say it reminds them of the smell of gangrene.",
    "In the old days, bodies were laid out at home for up to a week before burial, and everybody would have been familiar with the smell of death.",
    "Hawthorn brought inside the house would have instantly triggered the association.",
    "On the other hand, triethylamine is also the smell of sex: specifically of semen; hence its positive association with wild springtime rogering outside in the fields.",
    "As well as ‘may’, hawthorn is also known as usual by scads of bizarre vernacular names including ‘bread-and-cheese’, ‘arzy-garzies’ and ‘aglets’.",

    "Fresh coconut water is an excellent hangover cure.",
    "It is completely sterile, full of vitamins and minerals and has the same balance of salts as human blood (the technical term for this is isotonic).",
    "Because of this it can be used in place of a saline drip and is being commercially exploited as a sports drink, particularly in Brazil, where it is now a $75-million industry.",
    "Coconut water also ferments quickly and can be made into wine or vinegar.",
    "Far from being the world’s most dangerously fatty oil, it is now being marketed as the healthiest.",
    "It is rich in lauric acid, the saturated fat found in mother’s milk, and full of anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties.",

    "Now we know it is a combination of a lack of vitamins C and B, causing the body’s cells to break down, but in the eighteenth century it was treated with more superstition than knowledge.",
    "Many sailors believed that the touch of earth would cure it.",
    "The breakthrough came with the publication of Edinburgh physician James Lind’s Treatise on Scurvy in 1754, which advocated the use of citrus fruit and fresh vegetables.",
    "The legend is that Cook’s enlightened approach kept his ships free of the disease.",
    "The truth seems to be that Cook simply ignored it.",
    "The journals of his fellow officers indicate that it was widespread on all three voyages, although there were few deaths.",
    "When, in 1795, the Admiralty finally ordered ships to be supplied with citrus fruit (on Lind’s recommendation), it was lemon, not lime, juice that was supplied.",
    "By the 1850s, lemons were being replaced by limes for economic reasons (limes were grown by British businessmen in the colonies; lemons were grown by Johnny Foreigner in the Mediterranean).",
    "Scurvy returned with a vengeance as, ironically, limes contain very little vitamin C.",

    "And he wasn’t the first European to see the continent – the Dutch beat him by 150 years – or even the first Englishman to land there.",
    "That was William Dampier who, in 1697, was also the first to record a ‘large hopping animal’.",

    "The fear of Friday the 13th (which you now know to be totally unfounded) is called paraskavedekatriaphobia.",
    "It derives from two separate superstitions: that thirteen is unlucky and that Friday is too.",

    "Ancient Norsemen, by contrast, considered Friday the luckiest day of the week and, in parts of southern Europe, it is Tuesday the 13th that is feared.",
    "One theory is that the fear of Tuesdays dates to the Fall of Constantinople (on Tuesday 29 May 1453).",
    "Although it appears in Roman, Norse and Babylonian traditions, the fear of the number thirteen didn’t surface in modern Europe until the late seventeenth century, when it was held to be unlucky to invite thirteen guests to dinner because of the Last Supper (Judas being the last to sit down).",
    "In nineteenth-century Paris, an institution called the quatorzièmes&#160; (or ‘fourteeners’) would sit at home, fully dressed for dinner, between 5 p.m.",
    "and 9 p.m., ready to step in if a dinner party was found to have thirteen guests.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance How many Wise Men visited Jesus?",
    "It has generally been assumed that there were three of them because they brought three gifts, but it is quite possible that there were four and one forgot to get a present until after the shops were closed and had to come in on the frankincense.",

    "His most famous miracles usually involved children.",
    "In one, he restored to life three children who’d been chopped up by the local tavern owner and kept in a brine tub.",
    "Being kind to children explains his suitability as a Christmas saint, but St Nick is also the patron saint of judges, pawnbrokers, thieves, merchants, bakers, sea travellers and, oddly, murderers.",

    "It became one of the most popular children’s poems of all time.",
    "It’s not clear when the North Pole and the factory of elves became attached to the story, but it was established enough by 1927 for the Finns to claim that Santa Claus lived in Finnish Lapland, as no reindeer could live at the North Pole because there was no lichen.",

    "Raleigh never personally visited Virginia or any other part of North America.",
    "It was a Frenchman named Jean Nicot, from whose name the word ‘nicotine’ is derived, who introduced tobacco to France in 1560, and it was from France, not the New World, that tobacco reached England.",
    "Raleigh was a keen smoker and probably helped popularise the tobacco habit after he was introduced to it by Sir Francis Drake.",
    "The term ‘smoking’ is a late seventeenth-century coinage; until then it was referred to as ‘drinking smoke’.",
    "Potatoes were known in Spain by the mid-sixteenth century, and probably reached the British Isles from Europe, rather than directly from America.",
    "As a member of the nightshade family the plant was assumed to be poisonous (as, indeed, the upper portions are).",

    "From Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia through to India, Africa, China and Western Europe, hares have been portrayed as sacred, evil, wise, destructive, clever and, almost always, sexy.",
    "Maybe it’s because they are so fast – they can run at 77 kph (48 mph) and leap 2.5 metres (8 feet) in the air Or maybe it’s their astonishing fertility: a female hare (doe) can produce 42 leverets in a single year.",
    "Pliny the Elder believed eating hare would make you sexually attractive for up to nine days.",
    "Hares and rabbits are not rodents but ‘lagomorphs’ (which derives from the Greek for ‘hare-shaped’).",
    "Lagomorphs are peculiar in being able to close their nostrils and choosing to eat their own droppings.",
    "They do this for the same reasons cows chew the cud – to extract the maximum amount of nutrients and energy from their food.",

    "Charles Perrault, who wrote the familiar version of the story in the seventeenth century, misheard the word vair (squirrel fur) in the medieval tale he borrowed and updated for the similar-sounding verre (glass).",

    "Others think glass slippers were Perrault’s own idea and that he intended them all along.",
    "The OED states that vair , in use in English as well as French since at least 1300, comes from the Latin varius , ‘particoloured’, and refers to fur from a species of squirrel that is ‘much used for trimming or lining garments’.",
    "Snopes.com states that Perrault could not have misheard vair as verre because vair ‘was no longer used in his time’.",
    "This seems extremely doubtful – the word was continuously in use in English until at least 1864.",
    "Perrault was an upper-class Parisian author who rose to become Director of the Académie Française.",
    "His Tales of Mother Goose (1697), originally devised as Court entertainment and published under the name of his 17-year-old son, were immediately popular and opened up a new literary genre: the fairytale.",

    "Probably native to tropical Africa and Asia, it is grown throughout most of Asia and is cultivated commercially in the United States for export to Japan.",
    "The immature fruits, 7.5 to 15 cm (3 to 6 inches) in length, can be stir-fried whole or sliced, or they can be grated and used in soups and omelettes.",
    "Any fruits longer than 10 cm (4 inches) need to be peeled because the skin becomes bitter.",

    "Although it is the softest of woods, it is not, botanically, a softwood, but a hardwood.",
    "‘Hardwood’ is a botanical term that describes broadleaved, mostly deciduous trees which are angiosperms (flowering plants such as balsa) as opposed to coniferous gymnosperms (non-flowering plants such as pine).",

    "The first recorded use was by the Swiss naturalist Konrad Gessner in 1565.",
    "Henry David Thoreau, author of Walden , was the first American to successfully fire graphite with clay to make a pencil ‘lead’ but the big commercial breakthrough came in 1827, when Joseph Dixon of Salem, Massachusetts introduced a machine that mass-produced square graphite pencils at the rate of 132 per minute.",
    "By the time he died in 1869, the Joseph Dixon Crucible Company was the world leader, producing 86,000 round cased pencils a day.",

    "The word ‘banister’ (or, worse, ‘bannister’) is a misspelling of the original word.",
    "Though in common usage since at least 1667, Victorian dictionaries railed and blustered about the use of the word ‘banister’ as ‘improper’ and ‘vulgar’.",
    "However, you will be relieved to learn that it is now deemed acceptable.",
    "The word ‘newel’ – the bit with a knob on that stops you sliding off the end of the balustrade – has also changed its meaning.",
    "In due course, it came to mean any pillary bit associated with stairs, and eventually just the one at the end.",

    "Heron lived in Alexandria around AD 62, and is best known as a mathematician and geometer.",
    "He was also a visionary inventor and his aeolopile or ‘wind-ball’ was the first working steam engine.",
    "Using the same principle as jet propulsion, a steam-driven metal sphere spun round at 1,500 rpm.",
    "Unfortunately for Heron, no one was able to see its practical function, so it was considered nothing more than an amusing novelty.",
    "Amazingly, had Heron but known it, the railway had already been invented 700 years earlier by Periander, tyrant of Corinth.",
    "Called the Diolkos, or Slipway, it ran for 6 km (4 miles) across the isthmus of Corinth in Greece, and consisted of a roadway paved with limestone blocks in which were cut parallel grooves 1.5 m (5 feet) apart.",
    "Trolleys ran along these tracks, on to which ships were loaded.",
    "These were pushed by gangs of slaves forming a sort of ‘land-canal’ offering a short cut between the Aegean and the Ionian seas.",
    "The Diolkos was in use for some some 1,500 years until it fell into disrepair around AD 900.",
    "The principle of railways was then completely forgotten about for almost another 500 years, until people had the idea of using them in mines in the fourteenth century.",
    "The historian Arnold Toynbee wrote a brilliant essay speculating what would have happened if the two inventions had been combined to create a global Greek empire, based on a fast rail network, Athenian democracy and a Buddhist-style religion founded on the teachings of Pythagoras.",
    "He briefly mentions a failed prophet who lived at 4, Railway Cuttings, Nazareth.",

    "The earliest European cave art has been dated to 40,000 years ago, although the precise age is notoriously difficult to establish.",
    "The most persuasive explanation of its function relates it to more recent cave painting among hunter-gatherer people in southern Africa and Australia.",
    "Here the paintings were the work of shamans, who entered the dark and often remote caves in order to connect with the spirit world.",

    "This distance was 26 miles and 385 yards: the standard length of a marathon ever since.",
    "The origin of the 26-mile run dates to a Greek messenger called Pheidippides, who ran this distance from Marathon to Athens to relate the victory of the Athenians over the Persians in 490 BC .",
    "According to popular legend he delivered the message and then dropped dead.",
    "Very few marathon runners die after the event, and professional ancient Greek couriers were regularly required to run twice as far.",
    "This version of the story first appears in the work of the Roman historian Plutarch (c.",
    "It seems to have become confused with the much older story of Pheidippides recorded by Herodotus, who was born six years after the battle, and whose account is the nearest we have to a contemporary one.",
    "According to him, Pheidippides ran from Marathon to Sparta (246 km or 153 miles) to ask for help in beating off the Persian attack.",

    "After he has been dubbed, the new knight stands up (contrary to popular belief, the words ‘Arise, Sir —’ are not used), and The Queen then invests the knight with the insignia of the Order to which he has been appointed (a star or badge, depending on the Order).",
    "By tradition, clergy receiving a knighthood are not dubbed, as the use of a sword is thought inappropriate for their calling.’ The actual meaning of the English word accolade is ‘the salutation on the bestowal of knighthood’.",
    "It comes from Latin ad, ‘to’, and collum, ‘neck’ – hence, ‘an embrace round the neck’.",
    "There also used to be a ceremony associated with the removal of a knighthood: degradation.",
    "The last public degradation was in 1621, when Sir Francis Mitchell was found guilty of ‘grievous exactions’ and had his spurs broken and thrown away, his belt cut and his sword broken over his head.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance Why do Spaniards lisp?",
    "And, even if they did (despite what you may have heard) it has nothing to do with sucking up to the king.",
    "The first problem is that no one can agree which king this might have been: Ferdinand I, Charles I, Philip II are all regularly cited, but the only Spanish king who is recorded as having a lisp is Pedro of Castile (1334–69).",
    "What’s more, the man who alleged he had a lisp was López de Ayalla, who can hardly be counted as a reliable source, since he became chancellor under Pedro’s bastard brother, eventual usurper and murderer, Henry of Trastamara.",
    "As well as saying, he ‘lisped a little’ ( ‘ceceaba un poco’ ), Ayalla invented the slur that he was known as ‘Pedro the Cruel’.",
    "In fact, Pedro was very popular among merchants and tradesmen, and unusually tolerant of the Jews.",
    "Geoffrey Chaucer met him in his professional capacity as a diplomat, and admired him a great deal.",
    "In The Canterbury Tales , he called him the ‘Glory of Spain’.",
    "The second problem is that the so-called ‘Castilian lisp’ only began to develop in the sixteenth century, 200 years after Pedro died.",
    "Technically, a lisp is a mispronunciation of the ‘s’ sound.",
    "No normal Spanish speaker does this – España itself has an ‘s’ in it.",
    "The issue revolves around the pronunciation of ‘z’ and ‘c’ (when it comes before an ‘i’ or an ‘e’).",
    "In most of Spain, particularly Castile, the ‘th’ sound is used and this is distinguished clearly from the ‘s’ sound.",
    "So, casa is pronounced ‘carsa’ and caza is ‘cartha’.",
    "The second option is called ceceo (pronounced ‘theth-ayo’), in which both words are pronounced ‘cartha’.",
    "This ‘double-lisp’ is only found in southern parts of Andalusia and is considered extremely bumpkinish.",
    "The final option is seseo (pronounced ‘sesayo’), in which both the words are pronounced ‘carsa’.",
    "Basques and Catalans, for whom Soanish is a second language, tend to use this option and it is the pronunciation used in the Canary Islands and throughout Latin America.",
    "The reason for this is that seseo is also used in the area around Seville, the city that held the monopoly on trade with the New World, and the port from whence most explorers and emigrants left for the Americas.",
    "Pronunciation evolves and changes all the time as result of social pressures, such as the need to be understood, or the desire to fit in.",

    "No one is sure where ‘Brunanburh’ is: Tinsley Wood near Sheffield seems the best guess.",
    "The last King of ‘England’ – that is, the last King to rule England and nothing else – was Harold Godwinson or Harold II.",

    "The Conqueror’s Norman French companions would have called him ‘Guillaume’ and written it in Latin, Guillelmus (as it appears on his tomb in Caen).",

    "In the Americas, the hats were standard issue for the men digging the Panama Canal.",
    "President Theodore Roosevelt visited the site in 1906 and was photographed wearing one.",
    "The hat’s origins are ancient: ceramic figures wearing curious headpieces have been discovered on the Ecuadorian coast and date back to 4000 BC.",
    "Some archaeologists believe that the weaving skills needed to make a panama were acquired through contact with the Polynesian people of the Pacific, famous for their woven flax.",
    "The first Spaniards were so unnerved by the material’s translucent quality that they believed it was vampire skin.",
    "The modern hats date back to the sixteenth century and are made from the woven fibres of the ten-foot-tall panama-hat palm, the jipijapa or toquilla (its scientific name is Carludovica&#160; palmata ).",
    "They are mostly produced in the town of Cuenca, although the finest examples come from the towns of Montecristi and Biblian.",
    "The time it takes to make a panama hat varies enormously.",
    "The toquilla can be harvested only five days a month, during the moon’s final quarter, when the palm fibre holds less water, making it lighter and easier to weave.",
    "A skilled weaver can extract a fibre that is as fine as silk.",
    "A low-grade hat can be knocked out in a matter of hours, whereas a top quality, or superfino , hat can take five months to finish and sell for £ 1,000.",
    "In 1985 the Conran Foundation nominated the panama hat as one of the ‘100 best designs ever’ for an exhibition at the V&A.",
    "Ecuador is named after the Spanish word for ‘equator’.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance What nationality was the Duke of Wellington?",
    "Despite his reputation as one of England’s greatest generals, Arthur Wellesley, the 1st Duke of Wellington, was unarguably an Irishman.",
    "He was born in Dublin in 1769 into the Wesley family, whose seat was Dangan Castle, near Trim in County Meath.",
    "He later married into one of Ireland’s most notable families, the Longfords, and served in the Irish parliament in 1790.",
    "If further proof were needed of his nationality, there is also his decision to play for the All Ireland team in the first recorded game of cricket played in Ireland in August 1792.",
    "Their opponents were a team from the local British garrison in Dublin.",
    "The Duke notched up a distinctively unimpressive total of six runs from his two innings.",
    "The Duke’s grandfather, the 1st Baron Mornington, was called Richard Colley, but assumed the surname of Wesley after inheriting the estates of a distant relative.",
    "While the Colleys had been in Ireland for several centuries, the Wesleys were wealthier and could claim that their ancestor had arrived in Ireland as Henry II’s standard-bearer.",
    "In 1798, the Duke and his family changed their names to Wellesley, just because it sounded grander.",
    "Debate about the Duke’s Irishness was widespread during his lifetime.",
    "It is often claimed that he repudiated his link to Ireland by saying that ‘A man can be born in a stable, and yet not be an animal.’ However, there is no evidence he ever said this: it probably originated as scurrilous court gossip.",
    "Wellington remained as proud of his connections with Ireland as the Irish were of him; a monument 62.5 metres high (205 feet) stands in Phoenix Park in memory of his achievements.",
    "The other quote that he famously didn’t say was: ‘The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.’ It was first attributed to the Duke four years after he died in a work of Catholic propaganda by the French historian, Count de Montalembert.",
    "It’s worth pointing out that when Wellington briefly – and unsuccessfully – attended Eton, the school had no playing fields and he was a pupil noted for his lack of enthusiasm for, or talent at, games.",

    "The expression ‘Prime Minister’ was first officially used in 1905 just five days after he became one.",
    "Sir Robert Walpole, generally recognised as the first de facto Prime Minister, never used the word: he and his successors were ‘First Lords of the Treasury’.",
    "This included Campbell-Bannerman until 10 December 1905, when – in the first official use – a Royal Warrant placed the ‘Prime Minister’ in order of precedence after the Archbishop of York.",
    "Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman (1836–1908) was born Henry Campbell.",
    "The name Bannerman was added in 1871, as a condition to his inheriting his uncle’s estate.",
    "After succeeding Arthur James Balfour, who resigned in 1905, Campbell-Bannerman became Britain’s first official Prime Minister.",
    "His unusually strong cabinet included two future Prime Ministers (Asquith and Lloyd George) and he led the Liberals to a landslide victory in the 1906 General Election.",
    "More radical than liberal, he supported women’s suffrage and Irish devolution; introduced the Old Age Pension; improved the lot of the poor; denounced British ‘barbarism’ in the conduct of the Boer War; arranged self-government for much of South Africa; and pushed through the Trade Disputes Act in 1906 which gave unions considerable freedom to strike.",

    "This isn’t such a disaster, because those clever-clogs were wrong.",
    "William Dockwra had already established the London Penny Post 240 years earlier.",
    "It handled packets up to one pound in weight, there were several deliveries a day, and items were also delivered to addresses within ten miles of London for an extra charge of one penny.",
    "In 1683, Dockwra was forced to surrender his business to the government-operated General Post Office, a monopoly controlled by the Duke of York, later King James II.",
    "In 1764, Parliament authorised the creation of Penny Posts in any town or city of the UK.",
    "By the beginning of the nineteenth century several were in existence.",

    "Confucius (551–479 BC ) wrote: ‘News travels faster than the mail,’ so presumably the Chinese had one around that time too.",
    "The word ‘post’ comes from the Latin posita , ‘placed’, from the verb ponere , ‘to place’.",
    "The Roman postal service was two-tier: first class went by horse and second class by ox-cart.",
    "The word ‘mail’ comes from Old French male , a wallet or bag The Postmaster General in 1840, Lord Lichfield, criticised Hill’s scheme as ‘wild and visionary’ but it was an immediate success, especially with Queen Victoria.",
    "She liked the profile portrait of her on the Penny Black so much that she ordered that the same image be used on all subsequent issues of the stamp for the next sixty years.",
    "The first philatelist surfaced within a year of the first stamp being issued: a young woman who advertised in The Times for sufficient stamps to cover her bedroom walls.",
    "Because the UK was the first to issue them, British stamps have the unique distinction of not carrying the name of the issuing country.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Where does Chicken Tikka Masala come from?",
    "Invented in Glasgow in the late 1960s, chicken tikka masala, or CTM, is Britain’s most popular dish.",
    "In a recent survey, the Real Curry Guide tested forty-eight different versions and found the only common ingredient was chicken.",
    "Chicken tikka is a traditional Bangladeshi dish in which pieces of marinated chicken are cooked in a clay oven called a tandoor.",
    "This ancient style of cooking originated in the Middle East, the word deriving from the Babylonian tinuru, meaning ‘fire’.",
    "The first chicken tandoori on a British restaurant menu was at the Gaylord in Mortimer Street, London, in 1966 – the same restaurant where Not the Nine O’Clock News was invented in 1979.",
    "The recipe reached Glasgow shortly afterwards and when, as the legend goes, a customer asked for some gravy to go with it, the chef improvised with tomato soup, spices and cream.",
    "Masala means a mixture of spices, and the usual CTM contains ginger and garlic, tomatoes, butter and cream, spiced with cardamom, cloves, cumin, nutmeg, mild red chilli powder and paprika, fenugreek and turmeric.",
    "It is the turmeric that it gives it the bright yellow colour, although the synthetic dye tartrazine is often substituted.",
    "(It is tartrazine, among other unpleasant things, that makes curry stains impossible to remove from clothing.) CTM doesn’t have a standard style or colour: it can be yellow, brown, red, or green and chilli hot; creamy and mild; or very smooth and sweet.",
    "In 2001, the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook declared that: ‘Chicken tikka masala is now a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences.’ One in seven curries sold in the UK are CTMs – 23 million portions each year.",
    "Many of the schools and charities in the city of Sylhet in Bangladesh are funded by profits from the British chicken tikka masala boom.",

    "The earliest recorded recipe for the dish occurs in the work of the Roman cook Apicius in the first century AD.",
    "In his book The Art of Cooking, he writes, rather casually, that it’s just ‘another sweet dish’: ‘Break fine white bread, crust removed, into rather large pieces.",

    "This finds its counterpart in the German ( arme Ritter ), Danish ( arme riddere ), Swedish ( fattiga riddare ) and Finnish ( köyhät ritarit ) versions – all of which mean ‘poor knights’.",
    "One theory offered in explanation is that the most expensive part of a medieval banquet was dessert – spices and nuts were costly imports.",

    "The song, however, was a big hit and would inspire the French troops to their first great victory over the Austrians at the Battle of Valmy five months later.",
    "The rousing sentiments were easily appropriated to the Revolutionary cause, and hand-written copies of the song passed rapidly through the army.",
    "Particularly popular among volunteers from Marseilles, they carried their copies to Paris, where they sang it on their arrival at the Tuileries Palace on 10 August.",
    "On Bastille Day, 1795, ‘The Marseilles Song’ was adopted as the Republic’s national anthem.",

    "The first problem is that it wasn’t cake, it was brioche (the original French is Qu’ils mangent de la brioche ).",
    "According to Alan Davidson’s Oxford Companion to Food, ‘Eighteenth-century brioche was only lightly enriched (by modest quantities of butter and eggs) and not very far removed from a good white loaf of bread.’ So, the remark might have been an attempt at kindness: ‘If they want bread, give them some of the good stuff.’ Except Marie Antoinette didn’t say it.",
    "The line had been in use in print as an illustration of aristocratic decadence since at least 1760.",
    "Jean-Jacques Rousseau claimed he’d first heard it as early as 1740.",
    "Lady Antonia Fraser, Marie Antoinette’s most recent biographer, attributes the remark to the Queen Marie-Thérèse, wife of Louis XIV, ‘The Sun King’, but there is a host of other grand eighteenth-century ladies who might have said it.",
    "It’s also entirely possible it was made up for propaganda purposes.",
    "There is another story that suggests Marie Antoinette introduced croissants to France from her native Vienna.",
    "This seems highly unlikely, as the earliest French reference to a croissant isn’t until 1853.",

    "Before they were trained as mountain rescue dogs, they were used by the monks at the hospice in the Great St Bernard Pass – the Alpine route that links Switzerland to Italy – to carry food, as their large size and docile temperament made them good pack animals.",
    "The brandy barrel was the idea of a young English artist named Sir Edwin Landseer (1802–73), who was much favoured by Queen Victoria.",
    "He was a renowned painter of landscapes and animals, best known for his painting The Monarch of the Glen and for sculpting the lions around the base of Nelson’s Column.",
    "In 1831, he painted a scene called Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller featuring two St Bernards, one of them carrying a miniature brandy barrel around its neck, which he added ‘for interest’.",

    "Darwin’s son, Francis, commenting on his father’s letters, noted that the Gourmet Club enjoyed, among other things, hawk and bittern, but that ‘their zeal broke down over an old brown owl,’ which they found ‘indescribable’.&#160; Over the years, Darwin sharpened up considerably in the academic arena and lost his faith in God, but he never lost his taste for the allure of an interesting menu.",
    "During the voyage of the Beagle , he ate armadillos which, he said, ‘taste & look like duck’ and a chocolate-coloured rodent that was ‘the best meat I ever tasted’ – probably an agouti, whose family name is Dasyproctidae , Greek for ‘hairy bum’.",
    "In Patagonia, he tucked into a plate of puma (the mountain lion Felis concolor ) and thought it tasted rather like veal.",
    "Later, after exhaustively searching Patagonia for the Lesser Rhea, Darwin realised he had already eaten one for his Christmas dinner, while moored off Port Desire in 1833.",
    "The bird had been shot by Conrad Martens, the ship’s artist.",
    "Darwin assumed it was one of the common Greater Rheas, or ‘ostriches’, as he called them, and only realised his mistake when the plates were being cleared: ‘It was cooked and eaten before my memory returned.",
    "Fortunately the head, neck, legs, wings, many of the larger feathers, and a large part of the skin, had been preserved.’ He sent the bits back to the Zoological Society in London and the Rhea darwinii was named after him.",

    "When they flew south in the autumn, by complete coincidence, barnacle-laden driftwood also blew ashore.",
    "Some bright spark spotted this and made the connection.",
    "The Latin for Irish goose is Anser hiberniculae , Hibernia being the Roman name for Ireland.",
    "This was shortened to bernacae and by 1581 ‘barnacle’ was used for both the geese and the shellfish.",
    "Some dioceses allowed the eating of geese on fast days because they were a kind of fish, others because they came from a bird-bearing tree, and were ‘not born of the flesh’, and therefore a kind of vegetable or nut.",
    "Others didn’t, so papal intervention was required.",
    "Pope Innocent III finally banned goose-eating on fast days in 1215.",
    "Four hundred years later, the Royal Society still carried accounts of wood laden with ‘shells carrying the embryos of geese’ and even Linnaeus gave some credence to the legend by naming two species of barnacle Lepas anatifera (duck-bearing shellfish) and Lepas anserifera (goose-bearing shellfish).",

    "You may have heard it said that glass is a liquid which has cooled but not crystallised, and which just flows fantastically slowly.",
    "In support of the assertion that glass is a liquid, people often point to old church windows, where the glass is thicker at the bottom of the pane.",
    "The reason for this is not that the glass has flowed over time, but that medieval glaziers sometimes couldn’t cast perfectly uniform sheets of glass.",
    "When that happened, they preferred to stand the glass into the window with the thick edge at the bottom, for obvious reasons.",
    "The confusion about whether glass is a liquid or solid stems from a misreading of the work of German physicist Gustav Tammann (1861–1938) who studied glass and described its behaviour as it solidifies.",
    "He observed that the molecular structure of glass is irregular and disordered, unlike the neat arrangement of molecules in, say, metals.",

    "It was isolated in 1939 by Marguerite Perey at the Curie Institute in Paris.",
    "These elements are liquid at unusually low temperatures for metals because the arrangement of electrons in their atoms makes it hard for them to get close enough to each other to form a crystalline lattice.",

    "The third-densest element is platinum, followed by rhenium, neptunium, plutonium and gold.",
    "Lead is way, way down the list – it’s only half as dense as either osmium or iridium.",
    "Osmium (Os) is a very rare, very hard, silvery-blue metal discovered (along with iridium) in 1803 by the English chemist Smithson Tennant (1761–1815).",
    "Tennant was a vicar’s son from Richmond who was also the first man to show that diamond is a form of pure carbon.",
    "It gives off highly toxic osmium tetroxide, which has a pungent, irritating odour and can damage the lungs, skin and eyes and cause intense headaches.",
    "Osmium tetroxide has been used in fingerprinting because its vapour reacts with minute traces of oil left by the fingers to form black deposits.",
    "Its extreme hardness and resistance to corrosion made osmium useful in the manufacture of long-life gramophone styluses, compass needles and the nibs of quality fountainpens – hence the trade name Osmiroid.",
    "Osmium also has an unusually high melting point of 3,054 °C.",
    "In 1897, this inspired Karl Auer to create an osmium electric light-bulb filament to improve on the bamboo one used by Edison.",
    "Osmium was eventually replaced by tungsten, which melts at 3,407 °C.",
    "It derives from OSmium and WolfRAM, the German for tungsten.",
    "Less than 100 kg (220 lb) of osmium are produced worldwide every year.",
    "Iridium (Ir) is a yellowish white metal which, like osmium, is closely related to platinum.",
    "The name comes from iris , Greek for rainbow, because of the many beautiful colours its compounds produce.",
    "Iridium also has an extremely high melting point (2,446 °C) and is mainly used to make crucibles for metal foundries and to harden platinum.",
    "Iridium is one of the rarest elements on earth (eighty-fourth out of ninety-two) but improbably large amounts of it are found in the thin geological layer known as the KT boundary laid down about 65 million years ago.",

    "The Book of General Ignorance How do we measure earthquakes?",
    "In the last decade, the Richter scale has been superseded in seismological circles by the Moment Magnitude Scale or MMS.",
    "The MMS was devised in 1979 by seismologists Hiroo Kanamori and Tom Hanks (no relation) of the California Institute of Technology, who found the Richter scale unsatisfactory because it only measures the strength of the shock waves, which do not fully describe an earthquake’s impact.",
    "On the Richter scale, large earthquakes may have the same score but cause wildly different degrees of devastation.",
    "The Richter scale measures the seismic waves or vibration as experienced 600 km (373 miles) away.",
    "It was devised in 1935 by Charles Richter, who was also, like Kanamori and Hanks, a Caltech seismologist.",
    "He developed it with Beno Gutenberg, the first man to measure accurately the radius of the Earth’s core.",
    "Gutenberg died of flu in 1960 without living to measure the Great Chilean Earthquake (the largest ever recorded, which took place four months later).",
    "The MMS, by contrast, is an expression of the energy released by an earthquake.",
    "It multiplies the distance of the slip between the two parts of the fault by the total area affected.",
    "It was designed to give values that make sense when compared to their Richter equivalent.",
    "Both scales are logarithmic: a two-point increase means 100 times more power.",
    "A hand grenade scores 0.5 on the Richter scale, the Nagasaki atom bomb 5.0.",
    "The MMS is only used for large earthquakes, above 3.5 on the Richter scale.",
    "According to the US Geological Survey, on the basis of the area of damage (600,000 square km or 231,660 square miles) and the area it was felt in (5,000,000 square km or 1,930,502 square miles) the largest known earthquakes in North America were the little-known Mississippi River valley earthquakes of 1811–12.",

    "They may prove to be the Holy Grail of superconductor research – a material that can conduct electricity without resistance at normal temperatures.",
    "This would make a world of ‘floating’ trains and unimaginably fast computers a reality.",
    "At present, superconductors only function at unhelpfully low temperatures (the best so far recorded is –135 °C).",
    "Apart from perovskite, it is thought that the mantle is made from magnesio-wusstite (a form of magnesium oxide also found in meteorites), and a small amount of shistovite (named after Lev Shistov, a graduate student at Moscow University, who synthesised a new high-pressure form of silicon oxide in his lab in 1959).",
    "The earth’s mantle sits between the crust and the core.",
    "It is generally assumed to be solid, but some scientists believe that it is actually a very slow-moving liquid.",
    "Even the rocks spewed out of volcanoes have only come from the first 200 km (125 miles) below the surface and it’s 660 km (over 400 miles) before the lower mantle starts.",
    "By sending pulses of seismic waves downwards and recording the resistance they encounter, both the density and the temperature of the Earth’s interior can be estimated.",
    "This can then be matched to what we already know about the structure of minerals we do have samples of – from the crust and in meteorites – and what happens to these minerals under intense heat and high pressure.",

    "Many astronomers would say no, but they are certainly more than just run-of-the-mill asteroids.",
    "Like Earth they take roughly a year to orbit the Sun (think of two cars going round a race track at the same speed but in different lanes) and do, occasionally, come close enough to exert a very slight gravitational influence.",

    "Many insects use these light sources to navigate by day and night.",
    "Because the Moon and Sun are a long way away, the insects have evolved to expect the light from them to strike their eyes in the same place at different times of day or night, enabling them to calculate how to fly in a straight line.",
    "When people come along with their portable miniature suns and moons and a moth flies past, the light confuses it.",
    "It assumes it must somehow be moving in a curved path, because its position in relation to the stationary ‘sun’ or ‘moon’, has unexpectedly changed.",
    "The moth then adjusts its course until it sees the light as stationary again.",

    "British naval ships of the period were often rotten and unseaworthy.",
    "Many of the officers had no idea how to sail, fight or control their men.",
    "Hernias caused by manhandling acres of wet canvas were so common that the navy was forced to issue trusses.",
    "To cap it all there wasn’t a single pay rise for a century.",
    "At close range, a 32-pound ball was capable of penetrating wood to a depth of 60 cm (2 feet).",
    "The best way to stop splinters (other than by building a metal ship) was to use a type of wood found in the south-eastern USA which resisted splintering.",
    "As well as being one of the hardest of all woods, the Live Oak ( Quercus virginiana ) is the state tree of Georgia and a symbol of strength and resistance for the southern states.",
    "It is the tree draped with long garlands of moss in films like Gone with the Wind.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Which war killed the highest proportion of British soldiers?",
    "&#160; &#160; The English Civil War (or the ‘War of the Three Nations’ as historians now call it).",
    "In the seven years between 1642 and 1649, a staggering one in ten of the adult male population died, more than three times the proportion that died in the First World War and five times the proportion who died in the Second World War.",
    "The total UK population in 1642 is estimated at five million, of whom roughly two million were men of fighting age: 85,000 died on the battlefield, another 100,000 died of their wounds or of disease.",
    "The war was the biggest military mobilisation in English history with a quarter of those eligible to fight finding themselves in uniform.",
    "In Ireland, things were even worse as the Civil War merged into a doomed battle for independence.",
    "Some historians calculate that half the Irish population had perished by the end of Cromwell’s expedition in 1653.",
    "In a 2004 poll organised by the BBC, it was revealed that 90 per cent of Britons cannot name a single battle of the English Civil War, 80 per cent do not know which English king was executed by Parliament in 1649 and 67 per cent of schoolchildren have never heard of Oliver Cromwell.",
    "JEREMY HARDY ‘All anybody knows about it is the hairstyles.",
    "All anybody says, ‘Oh, it’s Roundheads and Cavaliers,’ and you think, ‘Yeah, that’s it, really, one lot looks like the Grumbleweeds, the other looked like Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen,’ so it all kicks off.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance What’s the word for Napoleon’s most humiliating defeat?",
    "While Waterloo was no doubt Napoleon’s most crushing defeat, it was not his most embarrassing.",
    "In 1807, Napoleon was in high spirits having signed the Peace of Tilsit, a landmark treaty between France, Russia and Prussia.",
    "To celebrate, he suggested that the Imperial Court should enjoy an afternoon’s rabbit-shooting.",
    "It was organised by his trusted chief-of-staff, Alexandre Berthier, who was so keen to impress Napoleon that he bought thousands of rabbits to ensure that the Imperial Court had plenty of game to keep them occupied.",
    "The party arrived, the shoot commenced, and the gamekeepers released the quarry.",
    "Berthier had bought tame, not wild, rabbits, who mistakenly thought they were about to be fed rather than killed.",
    "Rather than fleeing for their life, they spotted a tiny little man in a big hat and mistook him for their keeper bringing them food.",
    "The hungry rabbits stormed towards Napoleon at their top speed of 35 mph (56 kph).",
    "The shooting party – now in shambolic disarray – could do nothing to stop them.",
    "Napoleon was left with no other option but to run, beating the starving animals off with his bare hands.",
    "But the rabbits did not relent and drove the Emperor back to his carriage while his underlings thrashed vainly at them with horsewhips.",
    "According to contemporary accounts of the fiasco, the Emperor of France sped off in his coach, comprehensively beaten and covered in shame.",
    "The Book of General Ignorance Who blew the nose off the Sphinx?",
    "&#160; &#160; The Sphinx, which means ‘strangler’ in Greek, was a mythical beast with the head of a woman, the body of a lion and the wings of a bird.",
    "As you may have noticed, its giant 6,500-year-old statue beside the pyramids has no nose.",
    "Over the centuries, many armies and individuals – British, German and Arab – have been accused of deliberately blowing it off for various reasons, but Napoleon generally gets the blame.",
    "In fact, the only person that we can definitely say damaged it at all was an Islamic cleric named Sa’im al-dahr, who was lynched for vandalism in 1378.",
    "The British and the German armies in either of the two World Wars are not guilty: there are photographs of the Sphinx without its nose dating from 1886.",
    "As for Napoleon, there are sketches in existence of a noseless Sphinx done in 1737, thirty-two years before he was even born.",
    "When he first clapped eyes on it as a twenty-nine-year-old general, it had probably been missing for hundreds of years.",
    "Napoleon went to Egypt with a view to disrupting British communications with India.",
    "He fought two battles there: the battle of the Pyramids (which wasn’t, as it happens, at the Pyramids), and the battle of the Nile (which wasn’t at the Nile).",
    "As well as 55,000 troops, Napoleon brought with him 155 civilian experts known as ‘savants’.",
    "It was the first professional archaeological expedition to the country.",
    "When he returned to France after Nelson sank his fleet, the Emperor left behind his army and the savants, whose work continued.",
    "They produced the Description de l’Egypte , the first accurate picture of the country to reach Europe.",
    "Despite all this, Egyptian guides at the Pyramids today still tell tourists that the Sphinx’s nose was ‘stolen by Napoleon’ and taken back to the Louvre in Paris.",
    "The most likely reason for the missing organ is the action of 6,000 years of wind and weather on the soft limestone."
